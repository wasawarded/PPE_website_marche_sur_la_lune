   Mathematics with Proofs. But I'm not referring these.

   I mean Stephen Cole Kleene's Mathematical Logic like

     It begins with an elementary but thorough overview of mathematical
     logic of first order. The treatment extends beyond a single method
     of formulating logic to offer instruction in a variety of
     techniques: model theory (truth tables), Hilbert-type proof theory,
     and proof theory handled through derived rules. The second part

     number theory, with surveys of the famous incompleteness and
     undecidability results of Godel, Church, Turing, and others. The
     emphasis in the final chapter reverts to logic, with examinations of
     Godel's completeness theorem, Gentzen's theorem, Skolem's paradox
     and nonstandard models of arithmetic, and other theorems.

       $\begingroup$ "My friends and I don't know any economics degree
       that requires this Formal Mathematical Logic. Why?" This is
       something you should probably ask yourself and your friend. My
       experience is exactly the opposite. I dont know any economics

       $\begingroup$ I strongly recommend to cover at least some basics of
       Mathematical Logic. The literature is full with logical flawed
       articles. Hence, you should master a level to be able to recognize
       these failures by yourself. $\endgroup$

   questions. I will try to answer them separately.

   Question 1: To what extent does economics use Mathematical Logic?

   Answer: while an 'extent' is not something that can be easily measured

   every single page (save for preface, practice questions and reference
   page and few pages here and there). That is about 900 pages out of
   about 1000 page book that rely heavily on formal mathematical logic.

   In different sub-fields of economics the importance of rigorous
   mathematical proofs can vary but in most of them I cant think of any
   graduate text that would not lean heavily on formal mathematical logic.
   Maybe philosophy of economics or history of economic thought would be
   some exceptions (and even there for example Philosophy of Economics: A
   Contemporary Introduction by Julian Reiss includes some parts that are
   written in formal mathematical logic)

   Question 2: Do economics degrees require this [referring to subjects
   you mention inside the question] Formal Mathematical Logic?

   Answer: Generally not - I could not find any survey on this issue but I

   degree. The reason for that is that if you are good at mathematics you
   will be able to understand and even construct proofs without ever
   sitting in any course on formal mathematical logic. Any study of
   mathematics implicitly also teaches you formal mathematical logic -
   just not in necessary structured or obvious way.

     * Almost every Hermitian matrix has distinct eigenvalue differences
     * If models of first-order logic are defined using set theory, is
       every first-order theory implicitly an extension of set theory?
     * Is it impossible to physically observe whether an action is
