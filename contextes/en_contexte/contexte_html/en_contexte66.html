     1200-453314475-deductive-reasoning-example-4 Logic, n. The art of
     thinking and reasoning in strict accordance with the limitations and
     incapacities of the human misunderstanding. The basic of logic is
     the syllogism, consisting of a major and a minor premise and a
     conclusion – thus:
--

     This may be called syllogism arithmetical, in which, by combining
     logic and mathematics, we obtain a double certainty and are twice
     blessed.

     Ambrose Bierce The Unabridged Devil’s Dictionary

   In mainstream economics, both logic and mathematics are used
   extensively. And most mainstream economists sure look upon themselves
   as “twice blessed.”

   evidence or between law-like rules and explananda. In science, we argue
   and try to substantiate our beliefs and hypotheses with reliable
   evidence. Propositional and predicate deductive logic, on the other
   hand, is not about reliability, but the validity of the conclusions
   given that the premises are true.
--
   limitation since truth in the deductive context does not refer to a
   real-world ontology (only relating propositions as true or false within
   a formal-logic system) and as an argument scheme is totally
   non-ampliative — the output of the analysis is nothing else than the
   input.
--
   deductive certainty you are after, rather than the ampliative and
   defeasible reasoning in inference to the best explanation — well, then
   get in to math or logic, not science.

    3. Dave, I think you misread me here. I certainly have no problem at
       all with mathematics or logic per se. That’s not what I am
       criticising. Far from it. But to insist on always applying
       mathematical-formalistic models and theories — as is standard in

    4. As a mathematician, I just don’t see how this helps. Taking Lars’
       last paragraph, isn’t logic relevant to science? And in so far as
       science is interested in mathematical structures (such as numbers)
       isn’t mathematics essential to science?
--
       understand how science works at its best, and have instead taken
       their lead from some inadequate understanding of science and hence
       a misuse of logic and a misinterpretation of mathematical results.
       This seems a better explanation (to me) than Lars’ view is that
       logic and maths per se are to blame. (But maybe the teaching of
       maths and logic are at fault?)
