   (since it has thus far survived testing). Popper has defended what he
   calls “situational logic” (which is basically rational choice theory)
   as the correct method for the social sciences (1967, 1976). There
   appear to be serious tensions between Popper’s falsificationism and his
   defense of situational logic, and his discussion of situational logic
   has not been as influential as his falsificationism. For discussion of
   how situational logic applies to economics, see Hands (1985a).

   Given Popper’s falsificationism, there seems little hope of
