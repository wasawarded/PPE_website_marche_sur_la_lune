Abstract

   Logic is now widely recognized to be one of the foundational
   disciplines of computing with applications in virtually all aspects of
   the subject, from software engineering and hardware development to
   programming languages and artificial intelligence. There is a growing
   need for an in-depth survey of the applications of logic in AI and
   computer science. The Handbook of Logic in Artificial Intelligence and
   Logic Programming and its companion, Handbook of Logic in Computer
   Science, have been created in response to this need. This book is a
   combination of authoritative exposition, comprehensive survey, and
