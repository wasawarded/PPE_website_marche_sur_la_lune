Exploring Logic Programming for Artificial Intelligence: Algorithms and
Applications

--
   Alireza Alazmi*

   Logic Programming (LP) stands as a cornerstone in the realm of
   Artificial Intelligence (AI), offering powerful tools for knowledge
   representation, reasoning and problem-solving. This paper delves into

   with a primer on LP, we traverse through its historical evolution,
   highlighting key milestones and pivotal developments. Subsequently, we
   dissect fundamental LP paradigms, such as Prolog, Constraint Logic
   Programming (CLP) and Answer Set Programming (ASP), elucidating their
   unique features and operational mechanisms. The discourse then shifts
