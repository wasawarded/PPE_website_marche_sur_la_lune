What is Logic Programming?

   Logic programming is a programming strategy that uses logic circuits to
   control how facts and rules are expressed, rather than only
   mathematical functions. Often used in genetic and evolutionary

   accomplish, rather than how to accomplish it. Instead of a carefully
   structured control flow dictating when to execute and how to evaluate
   function calls or other instructions, the program’s logic rules are
   written as logical clauses (predicates).

How does Logic Programming Work?

   Each rule contains a head and body with formalized logic, instead of an
   executable mathematical function. For example,

   example, “To solve for X, sum B1, B2 and B3.”

   The other two most commonly used logic programming languages, Datalog
   and Answer Set Programming (ASP), are only declarative and don’t
   support explicit problem-solving instructions.
