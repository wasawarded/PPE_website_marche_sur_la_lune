   Prolog, short for “Programming in Logic,” stands out as a unique
   programming language with a profound impact on the field of Artificial
   Intelligence (AI). This article aims to provide an in-depth

Key Features of Prolog

     * Logic Programming:
     * Prolog is a logic programming language, allowing developers to
       express relationships and rules in a declarative manner. This
       paradigm is especially powerful for tasks that involve complex
--
       representation is essential.
     * Rule-Based Systems:
     * Many AI systems require the implementation of rule-based logic to
       make decisions or draw conclusions. Prolog’s rule-based nature and
       ability to express relationships in a logical manner make it a
--
       useful in scenarios where decision-making involves intricate
       logical conditions.
     * Constraint Logic Programming:
     * Prolog’s support for constraint logic programming allows developers
       to specify relationships and constraints within the program. This
       feature is beneficial in AI applications where problems involve
