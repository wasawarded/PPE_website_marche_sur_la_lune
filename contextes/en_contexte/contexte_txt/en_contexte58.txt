   A logic analyzer is an electronic instrument that captures and displays
   multiple logic signals from a digital system or digital circuit. A
   logic analyzer may convert the captured data into timing diagrams,
   protocol decodes, state machine traces, opcodes, or may correlate
   opcodes with source-level software. Logic analyzers have advanced
   triggering capabilities, and are useful when a user needs to see the
   timing relationships between many signals in a digital system.^[1]

   Presently, there are three distinct categories of logic analyzers
   available on the market:
     * Modular LAs, which consist of both a chassis or mainframe and logic
       analyzer modules.^[2] The mainframe/chassis contains the display,
       controls, control computer, and multiple slots into which the
       actual data-capturing hardware is installed. The modules each have
       a specific number of channels, and multiple modules may be combined
       to obtain a very high channel count. While modular logic analyzers
       are typically more expensive, the ability to combine multiple
       modules to obtain a high channel count and the generally higher
       performance of modular logic analyzers often justifies the price.
       For the very high end modular logic analyzers, the user often must
       provide their own host PC or purchase an embedded controller
       compatible with the system.^[3]

     * Portable LAs,^[4] sometimes referred to as standalone LAs. Portable
       logic analyzers integrate everything into a single package, with
       options installed at the factory. While portable logic analyzers
       generally have lower performance than their modular counterparts,
       they are often used for general purpose debugging by cost conscious

   A logic analyzer can be triggered on a complicated sequence of digital
   events, then capture a large amount of digital data from the system
   under test (SUT).

   When logic analyzers first came into use, it was common to attach
   several hundred "clips" to a digital system. Later, specialized
   connectors came into use. The evolution of logic analyzer probes has
   led to a common footprint that multiple vendors support, which provides
   added freedom to end users. Introduced in April, 2002, connectorless

   Many digital designs, including those of ICs, are simulated to detect
   defects before the unit is constructed. The simulation usually provides
   logic analysis displays. Often, complex discrete logic is verified by
   simulating inputs and testing outputs using boundary scan. Logic
   analyzers can uncover hardware defects that are not found in
   simulation. These problems are typically too difficult to model in

   Field-programmable gate arrays have become a common measurement point
   for logic analyzers and are also used to debug the logic circuit.

   Logic Analyzers are also very useful when it comes to analyze serial
   protocols, like I2C, SPI or UART, as they allow to capture long logic
   sequences showing one or several communication frames. Usually, the
   Logic Analyzer software will also interpret the protocol layer, making
   debugging of firmware less tedious task.

   The HP 5000A Logic Analyzer, introduced in the October 1973 issue of
   the Hewlett-Packard Journal, was probably the first commercially
   available instrument to be called a "Logic Analyzer". However, the HP
   5000A was limited to two channels and presented information by means of
   two rows of 32 LEDs. The first truly parallel instrument was the twelve

   Mixed-signal oscilloscopes combine the functionality of a digital
   storage oscilloscope with a logic analyzer. The several benefits of
   these include the ability to view analog and digital signals together
   in time, and to trigger on either digital or analog signals and capture
   on the other. A few limitations of mixed signal oscilloscopes are that
   they do not capture state-mode data, they have a limited channel count,
   and do not provide the analytical depth and insight of a logic
   analyzer.
