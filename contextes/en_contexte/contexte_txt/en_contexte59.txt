   Software that is inherently malicious, such as viruses and worms, often
   contain logic bombs that execute a certain payload at a pre-defined

   activate on certain dates are often called "time bombs".

   To be considered a logic bomb, the payload should be unwanted and
   unknown to the user of the software. As an example, trial programs with
   code that disables certain functionality after a set time are not
   normally regarded as logic bombs.
