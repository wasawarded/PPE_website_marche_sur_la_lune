   In this chapter, we will focus logic programming and how it helps in
   Artificial Intelligence.

   We already know that logic is the study of principles of correct
   reasoning or in simple words it is the study of what comes after what.
   For example, if two statements are true then we can infer any third

Concept

   Logic Programming is the combination of two words, logic and
   programming. Logic Programming is a programming paradigm in which the
   problems are expressed as facts and rules by program statements but
   within a system of formal logic. Just like other programming paradigms
   like object oriented, functional, declarative, and procedural, etc., it
   is also a particular way to approach programming.

How to Solve Problems with Logic Programming

   Logic Programming uses facts and rules for solving the problem. That is
   why they are called the building blocks of Logic Programming. A goal
   needs to be specified for every program in logic programming. To
   understand how a problem can be solved in logic programming, we need to
   know about the building blocks − Facts and Rules −

Facts

   Actually, every logic program needs facts to work with so that it can
   achieve the given goal. Facts basically are true statements about the
   program and data. For example, Delhi is the capital of India.
--
   all the rules must be defined.

   Rules are very important to solve any problem in Logic Programming.
   Rules are basically logical conclusion which can express the facts.
   Following is the syntax of rule −

Installing Useful Packages

   For starting logic programming in Python, we need to install the
   following two packages −

--

   It provides us a way to simplify the way we made code for business
   logic. It lets us express the logic in terms of rules and facts. The
   following command will help you install kanren −
pip install kanren
--
pip install sympy

Examples of Logic Programming

   Followings are some examples which can be solved by logic programming −

Matching mathematical expressions

   Actually we can find the unknown values by using logic programming in a
   very effective way. The following Python code will help you match a
   mathematical expression −

Checking for Prime Numbers

   With the help of logic programming, we can find the prime numbers from
   a list of numbers and can also generate prime numbers. The Python code
   given below will find the prime number from a list of numbers and will

Solving Puzzles

   Logic programming can be used to solve many problems like 8-puzzles,
   Zebra puzzle, Sudoku, N-queen, etc. Here we are taking an example of a
   variant of Zebra puzzle which is as follows −
