Weekend read – Logic and truth in economics

   November 8, 2024 Lars Syll Leave a comment Go to comments

   from Lars Syll

   Logic yields validity, not truth. - Post by Ziya on Boldomatic To be
   ‘analytical’ and ‘logical’ is something most people find recommendable.
   These words have a positive connotation. Scientists think more deeply
   than most other people because they use ‘logical’ and ‘analytical’
   methods. In dictionaries, logic is often defined as “reasoning
   conducted or assessed according to strict principles of validity” and
   ‘analysis’ as having to do with “breaking something down.”

   But that’s not the whole picture. As used in science, analysis usually
   means something more specific. It means to separate a problem into its
   constituent elements so as to reduce complex — and often complicated —
   wholes into smaller (simpler) and more manageable parts. You take the
   whole and break it down (decompose) into its separate parts. Looking at
   the parts separately one at a time you are supposed to gain a better
   understanding of how these parts operate and work. Built on that more
   or less ‘atomistic’ knowledge you are then supposed to be able to
   predict and explain the behaviour of the complex and complicated whole.

   In economics, that means you take the economic system and divide it
   into its separate parts, analyse these parts one at a time, and then
   after analysing the parts separately, you put the pieces together.

   The ‘analytical’ approach is typically used in economic modelling,
   where you start with a simple model with few isolated and idealized
   variables. By ‘successive approximations,’ you then add more and more
   variables and finally get a ‘true’ model of the whole.

   This may sound like a convincing and good scientific approach.

   But there is a snag!

   The procedure only really works when you have a machine-like
   whole/system/economy where the parts appear in fixed and stable
   configurations. And if there is anything we know about reality, it is
   that it is not a machine! The world we live in is not a ‘closed’
   system. On the contrary, it is an essentially ‘open’ system. Things are
   uncertain, relational, interdependent, complex, and ever-changing.

   Without assuming that the underlying structure of the economy that you
   try to analyze remains stable/invariant/constant, there is no chance
   the equations of the model remain constant. That’s the
   very rationale why economists use (often only implicitly) the
   assumption of ceteris paribus. But — nota bene — this can only be a
   hypothesis. You have to argue the case. If you cannot supply any
   sustainable justifications or warrants for the adequacy of making that
   assumption, then the whole analytical economic project becomes
   pointless non-informative nonsense. Not only do we have to assume that
   we can shield variables from each other analytically (external
   closure), but we also have to assume that each and every variable
   themselves are amenable to be understood as stable and
   regularity-producing machines (internal closure). Which, of course, we
   know is as a rule not possible. Some things, relations, and structures
   are not analytically graspable. Trying to analyse parenthood, marriage,
   employment, etc, piece by piece doesn’t make sense. To be a chieftain,
   a capital owner, or a slave is not an individual property of an
   individual. It can come about only when individuals are integral parts
   of certain social structures and positions. Social relations and
   contexts cannot be reduced to individual phenomena. A cheque
   presupposes a banking system and being a tribe-member presupposes a
   tribe.  Not taking this into account in their ‘analytical’ approach,
   economic ‘analysis’ becomes uninformative nonsense.

   Using ‘logical’ and ‘analytical’ methods in social sciences means that
   economists succumb to the fallacy of composition — the belief that the
   whole is nothing but the sum of its parts.  In society and in the
   economy this is arguably not the case. An adequate analysis of society
   and economy a fortiori cannot proceed by just adding up the acts and
   decisions of individuals. The whole is more than a sum of parts.

   Mainstream economics is built on using the ‘analytical’ method. The
   models built with this method presuppose that social reality is
   ‘closed.’ Since social reality is known to be fundamentally ‘open,’ it
   is difficult to see how models of that kind can explain anything about
   what happens in such a universe. Postulating closed conditions to make
   models operational and then imputing these closed conditions to
   society’s real structure is an unwarranted procedure that does not take
   necessary ontological considerations seriously.

   Faced with the kind of methodological individualism and rational choice
   theory that dominate mainstream economics we have to admit that even if
   knowing the aspirations and intentions of individuals are necessary
   prerequisites for giving explanations of social events, they are far
   from sufficient. Even the most elementary ‘rational’ actions in society
   presuppose the existence of social forms that it is not possible to
   reduce to the intentions of individuals. Here, the ‘analytical’ method
   fails again.

   The overarching flaw with the ‘analytical’ economic approach using
   methodological individualism and rational choice theory is basically
   that they reduce social explanations to purportedly individual
   characteristics. But many of the characteristics and actions of the
   individual originate in and are made possible only through society and
   its relations. Society is not a Wittgensteinian ‘Tractatus-world’
   characterized by atomistic states of affairs. Society is not reducible
   to individuals, since the social characteristics, forces, and actions
   of the individual are determined by pre-existing social structures and
   positions. Even though society is not a volitional individual, and the
   individual is not an entity given outside of society, the individual
   (actor) and the society (structure) have to be kept analytically
   distinct. They are tied together through the individual’s reproduction
   and transformation of already given social structures.

   Since at least the marginal revolution in economics in the 1870s it has
   been an essential feature of economics to ‘analytically’ treat
   individuals as essentially independent and separate entities of action
   and decision. But, really, in such a complex, organic and evolutionary
   system as an economy, that kind of independence is a deeply unrealistic
   assumption to make. To simply assume that there is strict independence
   between the variables we try to analyze doesn’t help us the least if
   that hypothesis turns out to be unwarranted.

   To be able to apply the ‘analytical’ approach, economists have to
   basically assume that the universe consists of ‘atoms’ that exercise
   their own separate and invariable effects in such a way that the whole
   consists of nothing but an addition of these separate atoms and their
   changes. These simplistic assumptions of isolation, atomicity, and
   additivity are, however, at odds with reality. In real-world settings,
   we know that the ever-changing contexts make it futile to search for
   knowledge by making such reductionist assumptions. Real-world
   individuals are not reducible to contentless atoms and so not
   susceptible to atomistic analysis. The world is not reducible to a set
   of atomistic ‘individuals’ and ‘states.’ How variable X works and
   influences real-world economies in situation A cannot simply be assumed
   to be understood or explained by looking at how X works in situation B.
   Knowledge of X probably does not tell us much if we do not take into
   consideration how it depends on Y and Z. It can never be legitimate
   just to assume that the world is ‘atomistic.’ Assuming real-world
   additivity cannot be the right thing to do if the things we have around
   us rather than being ‘atoms’ are ‘organic’ entities.

   If we want to develop new and better economics we have to give up on
   the single-minded insistence on using a deductivist straitjacket
   methodology and the ‘analytical’ method. To focus scientific endeavours
   on proving things in models is a gross misapprehension of the purpose
   of economic theory. Deductivist models and ‘analytical’ methods
   disconnected from reality are not relevant to predicting, explaining or
   understanding real-world economies

   To have ‘consistent’ models and ‘valid’ evidence is not enough. What
   economics needs are real-world relevant models and sound evidence.
   Aiming only for ‘consistency’ and ‘validity’ is setting the economics
   aspirations level too low for developing a realist and relevant
   science.

   Economics is not mathematics or logic. It’s about society. The real
   world.

   Models may help us think through problems. But we should never forget
   that the formalism we use in our models is not self-evidently
   transportable to a largely unknown and uncertain reality. The tragedy
   with mainstream economic theory is that it thinks that the logic and
   mathematics used are sufficient for dealing with our real-world
   problems. They are not! Model deductions based on questionable
   assumptions can never be anything but pure exercises in hypothetical
   reasoning.

   The world in which we live is inherently uncertain and quantifiable
   probabilities are the exception rather than the rule. Every statement
   about it is attached a ‘weight of argument’ that makes it impossible to
   reduce our beliefs and expectations to a one-dimensional stochastic
   probability distribution. If “God does not play dice” as Einstein
   maintained, I would add “nor do people.” The world as we know it has
   limited scope for certainty and perfect knowledge. Its intrinsic and
   almost unlimited complexity and the interrelatedness of its organic
   parts prevent the possibility of treating it as constituted by ‘legal
   atoms’ with discretely distinct, separable and stable causal relations.
   Our knowledge accordingly has to be of a rather fallible kind.

   If the real world is fuzzy, vague and indeterminate, then why should
   our models build upon a desire to describe it as precise and
   predictable? Even if there always has to be a trade-off between
   theory-internal validity and external validity, we have to ask
   ourselves if our models are relevant.

   ‘Human logic’ has to supplant the classical — formal — logic of
   deductivism if we want to have anything of interest to say of the real
   world we inhabit. Logic is a marvellous tool in mathematics and
   axiomatic-deductivist systems, but a poor guide for action in
   real-world systems, in which concepts and entities are without clear
   boundaries and continually interact and overlap. In this world, I would
   say we are better served with a methodology that takes into account
   that the more we know, the more we know we do not know.

       All right! Let us admit that

     Logic is a marvelous tool in mathematics and axiomatic-deductivist
     systems, but a poor guide for action in real-world systems, in which
     concepts and entities are without clear boundaries and continually
     interact and overlap.
       Do you have, Lars Syll, any good guiding principle for concept
       creation and theory making?

       Lars Syll has once again captured well some fundamental problems
       with neoclassical economics. One of my favorite sociologists, Rose
       Goldsen, often taught by expanding on aphorisms.  One she often
       used that captures Lars argument succinctly is that too many
       sociologists focus on “the characteristics of the individual
       instead of the properties of the system.”
       I also wonder about the fundamental limits of logic even in the
       sciences, perhaps most especially in the social sciences.  I teach
       in an education college with a colleague who is knowledgeable and
       an advocate of the insights of Eastern philosophies and religions
       as well as indigenous knowledges.  She views the need for social
       change linked to individual inner change in mindfulness and a broad
       idea of spirituality.  I wonder what attention to spirituality,
       mindfulness, and love might mean to “analysis” in economics?  I’m
       not qualified to answer that, but I have read a little about
       Buddhist economics and Islamic economics that might help supplement
       our focus on “logic.”

       The nature of economics involves doing the most useful and
       worthwhile thing with the expenditure of the least effort and
       resources. Event though it combines labour, land and capital, it is
       not directly connected with human attitudes within a sociological
       backing. The measure of this economics activity is through the
       amounts of money being exchanged in the process. The various parts
       or sectors of the whole arrangement (which we can now see as being
       a system), come together and exchange goods and services with
       money. Although the money is a bit difficult to use for analysis,
       due to its variation in exact worth over time, there is nothing
       else more suitable. Therefore it enables a fairly good way for use
       and application to logical analysis, particularly for simulation of
       the whole system over time, and also of the reactions within its
       individual and separately acting parts.
       Much as it can be claimed that economics also includes the
       sociological aspects noted above, we do not have any useful ways of
       combining the measure of these should such a measure even be
       possible, with the nature and analysis of business in trading and
       industry. Consequently it seems to me that we need to separate
       these aspects into two different topics and treat them
       independently.
       Disregarding the unmeasurable sociological aspects, only the
       business economics of the whole system (of macroeconomics) is a
       necessary and sufficient subject, when we want to evaluate economic
       progress and to simulate the effects of taking different national
       policies. By the use of this resulting and necessary approach we
       can turn what started as a complex mixture of different kinds of
       relationships into a much more exact process and better science.
       The decision to separate sociology from macroeconomics is not an
       easy one, due to how the whole subject has been introduced to
       students, some of whom will later become supporters of the various
       schools of thought in economics. However, the need to take the
       approach that I am claiming, will lead to more progress in
       understanding, but obviously it must receive a lot of opposition
       from those whose teaching methods have previously become firmly
       established. Without making this separation there will always be
       confusion and complexity that spoils and distorts any real progress
       toward the better understanding and scientific knowledge (of what
       was previously described by most of the experts as a
       pseudo-science), instead of graduating into a proper one.
