   My economics program had a class that transitions or introduces to
   proofs with books like Bridge to Abstract Mathematics , Reading,
   Writing, and Proving: A Closer Look at Mathematics or A Transition to
   Mathematics with Proofs. But I'm not referring these.

   I mean Stephen Cole Kleene's Mathematical Logic like

     It begins with an elementary but thorough overview of mathematical
     logic of first order. The treatment extends beyond a single method
     of formulating logic to offer instruction in a variety of
     techniques: model theory (truth tables), Hilbert-type proof theory,
     and proof theory handled through derived rules. The second part
     supplements the previously discussed material and introduces some of
     the newer ideas and the more profound results of twentieth-century
     logical research. Subsequent chapters explore the study of formal
     number theory, with surveys of the famous incompleteness and
     undecidability results of Godel, Church, Turing, and others. The
     emphasis in the final chapter reverts to logic, with examinations of
     Godel's completeness theorem, Gentzen's theorem, Skolem's paradox
     and nonstandard models of arithmetic, and other theorems.

   or An Introduction to Mathematical Logic (Dover Books on Mathematics

     Topics include the theorems of Gödel, Church, and Tarski on
     incompleteness, undecidability, and indefinability; a rigorous
     treatment of recursive functions and recursive relations;
     computability theory; and Hilbert's Tenth Problem

   or Christopher Leary's A Friendly Introduction to Mathematical Logic

     In this expansion of Leary's user-friendly 1st edition, readers with
     no previous study in the field are introduced to the basics of model
     theory, proof theory, and computability theory. The text is designed
     to be used either in an upper division undergraduate classroom, or
     for self study. Updating the 1st Edition's treatment of languages,
     structures, and deductions, leading to rigorous proofs of Gödel's
     First and Second Incompleteness Theorems, the expanded 2nd Edition
     includes a new introduction to incompleteness through computability
     as well as solutions to selected exercises.

       $\begingroup$ "My friends and I don't know any economics degree
       that requires this Formal Mathematical Logic. Why?" This is
       something you should probably ask yourself and your friend. My
       experience is exactly the opposite. I dont know any economics
       degree that would not require at least surface level covering of
       majority of the topics covered in the links you provided.

       $\begingroup$ I strongly recommend to cover at least some basics of
       Mathematical Logic. The literature is full with logical flawed
       articles. Hence, you should master a level to be able to recognize
       these failures by yourself. $\endgroup$

       $\begingroup$ The title of your question and the actual question
       differ. And no, you do not need to learn model theory or proof
       theory to do economics. $\endgroup$

   As pointed out in the comments this question asks two different
   questions. I will try to answer them separately.

   Question 1: To what extent does economics use Mathematical Logic?

   Answer: while an 'extent' is not something that can be easily measured
   I think it is fair to say that in theoretical part of economics is
   virtually omnipresent. Consider the following fact:

   MWG Microceonomic Theory - which is arguably the most popular and
   comprehensive graduate text for microeconomic theory has a rigorous
   proof derived from rigorous definitions and propositions on virtually
   every single page (save for preface, practice questions and reference
   page and few pages here and there). That is about 900 pages out of
   about 1000 page book that rely heavily on formal mathematical logic.

   In different sub-fields of economics the importance of rigorous
   mathematical proofs can vary but in most of them I cant think of any
   graduate text that would not lean heavily on formal mathematical logic.
   Maybe philosophy of economics or history of economic thought would be
   some exceptions (and even there for example Philosophy of Economics: A
   Contemporary Introduction by Julian Reiss includes some parts that are
   written in formal mathematical logic)

   Question 2: Do economics degrees require this [referring to subjects
   you mention inside the question] Formal Mathematical Logic?

   Answer: Generally not - I could not find any survey on this issue but I
   think its fair to say majority of economic degrees do not have such
   courses that you mentioned as requirement to graduate and obtain a
   degree. The reason for that is that if you are good at mathematics you
   will be able to understand and even construct proofs without ever
   sitting in any course on formal mathematical logic. Any study of
   mathematics implicitly also teaches you formal mathematical logic -
   just not in necessary structured or obvious way.

   As a matter of fact these fields [referring to the courses you mention]
   are relatively new subfields of mathematics and as Michael Greinecker
   pointed out in comments, "Mathematicians have proved theorems long
   before these subfields emerged." To see this you can just look at the
   beautiful and rigorous proofs in Euclid's Elements that were drafted
   thousands of years ago yet most of them still hold up and are quite
   rigorous.

   This being said, taking formal class on introduction into making formal
   mathematical proofs should improve your own proof-making and
   understanding of proofs and help you to make your own future work more
   rigorous. The question is whether this benefit outweighs the
   opportunity cost of that lost time - but that is opinionated question I
   won't go into.

   I think this can be the best explained by following analogy:

   This is like asking to what extent economics uses linguistics and its
   sub-fields of grammar, stylistics etc. Well again linguistic is
   omnipresent in economics as most papers are not just proofs with zero
   text. However, is it necessary to take academic writing class or class
   in stylistic or grammar to be an economist or to get an economic
   degree? Well no, I think its fair to say most science degrees will have
   only optional writing classes and many not even that.

   Many people will just learn how to write excellent academic works just
   by reading other papers. However, at the same time any person's writing
   would undoubtedly benefit by taking some academic writing class where
   you are exposed to stylistics and other sub-fields of linguistics even
   if it is not required to ever have such class.
