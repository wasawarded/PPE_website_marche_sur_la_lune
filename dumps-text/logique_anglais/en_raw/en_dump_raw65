   Lean Logic: A Dictionary for the Future and How to Survive It
   the late Dr. David Fleming
   LeanLogic.online, 2020
   Level: beginner
   Perspectives: Behavioral Economics, Complexity Economics, Ecological
   Economics, Evolutionary Economics, Other
   Topic: (De-)growth, Globalization & International Economic Relations,
   Reflection of Economics, Social movements & Transformation
   Format: Website
   Link: https://leanlogic.online/

   From the publisher: Lean Logic is the late David Fleming’s masterpiece,
   the product of more than thirty years’ work and a testament to the
   creative brilliance of one of Britain’s most important intellectuals. A
   dictionary unlike any other, it leads readers through Fleming’s
   stimulating exploration of fields as diverse as culture, history,
   science, art, logic, ethics, myth, economics, and anthropology, being
   made up of four hundred and four engaging essay-entries covering topics
   such as Boredom, Community, Debt, Growth, Harmless Lunatics, Land, Lean
   Thinking, Nanotechnology, Play, Religion, Spirit, Trust, and Utopia.
   The threads running through every entry are Fleming’s deft and original
   analysis of how our present market-based economy is destroying the very
   foundations—ecological, economic, and cultural— on which it depends,
   and his core focus: a compelling, grounded vision for a cohesive
   society that might weather the consequences. A society that provides a
   satisfying, culturally-rich context for lives well lived, in an economy
   not reliant on the impossible promise of eternal economic growth. A
   society worth living in. Worth fighting for. Worth contributing to. The
   beauty of the dictionary format is that it allows Fleming to draw
   connections without detracting from his in-depth exploration of each
   topic. Each entry carries intriguing links to other entries, inviting
   the enchanted reader to break free of the imposed order of a
   conventional book, starting where she will and following the links in
   the order of her choosing. In combination with Fleming’s refreshing
   writing style and good-natured humor, it also creates a book perfectly
   suited to dipping in and out. The decades Fleming spent honing his
   life’s work are evident in the lightness and mastery with which Lean
   Logic draws on an incredible wealth of cultural and historical
   learning—from Whitman to Whitefield, Dickens to Daly, Kropotkin to
   Kafka, Keats to Kuhn, Oakeshott to Ostrom, Jung to Jensen, Machiavelli
   to Mumford, Mauss to Mandelbrot, Leopold to Lakatos, Polanyi to Putnam,
   Nietzsche to Næss, Keynes to Kumar, Scruton to Shiva, Thoreau to
   Toynbee, Rabelais to Rogers, Shakespeare to Schumacher, Locke to
   Lovelock, Homer to Homer-Dixon—in demonstrating that many of the
   principles it commends have a track-record of success long pre-dating
   our current society. Fleming acknowledges, with honesty, the challenges
   ahead, but rather than inducing despair, Lean Logic is rare in its
   ability to inspire optimism in the creativity and intelligence of
   humans to nurse our ecology back to health; to rediscover the
   importance of place and play, of reciprocity and resilience, and of
   community and culture.

   Developed by Fleming fan Matthew Taylor with the blessing of the
   publishers, LeanLogic.online offers the full content of the late David
   Fleming's famous 'Dictionary for the Future and How to Survive It', for
   free. Given the unique inter-linked nature of that book, it feels very
   natural thing to encounter in the form of a custom-built, searchable
   website, allowing for the sharing of direct links to specific pages of
   interest to a particular friend. Fleming's own introduction provides
   the perfect place to start in his all-encompassing holisic vision of
   post-growth economics: https://leanlogic.online/guide-lean-logic/

   Galbraith first explores the social darwinism of Herbert Spencer and
   others that served as apology for the highly unequal distribution of
   wealth in the US at the end of the 19th century and naturalized
   differences in wealth by appealing to the concept of natural selection
   of the fittest. Then some instances of the unscrupulous business
   practices (i.e. robberies) of the American railroad tycoons and other
   business magnates are recounted. Lastly, Galbraith lines out some of
   the arguments of Thorstein Veblen, who delegitimized and ridiculed the
   business and leisure activities of the rich by putting them in the same
   category as predatory and ritualized practices of primitive or ancient
   societies.

   The Age of Uncertainty Episode 2 - The Manners and Morals of High
   Capitalism
   John Kenneth Galbraith

   Geldökonomien vermitteln nicht einfach Wirtschaftssubjekte; sie führen
   zu einer charakteristischen Trennung zwischen Arbeitenden und
   Konsumenten. Während die klassische Ökonomie die Arbeit in den
   Mittelpunkt rückte, sollen nach neoklassischer Lehre die Konsumenten
   durch ihre Präferenzen die gesamte Ökonomie über die Preise steuern.
   Diese Denkfigur wird nachfolgend in ihrer ideologischen Funktion
   dechiffriert. Die Reduktion der meisten Menschen auf die Rolle passiver
   Konsumenten, die andererseits beim Gelderwerb dem Diktat des Eigentums
   als Arbeitskraft subsumiert sind, prägt sowohl die Struktur der
   modernen kapitalistischen Gesellschaften wie die Psyche der Menschen.
   Die Dualität von Tätig-Sein und Güter-Haben entpuppt sich als
