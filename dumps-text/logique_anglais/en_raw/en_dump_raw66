On the use of logic and mathematics in economics

     1200-453314475-deductive-reasoning-example-4 Logic, n. The art of
     thinking and reasoning in strict accordance with the limitations and
     incapacities of the human misunderstanding. The basic of logic is
     the syllogism, consisting of a major and a minor premise and a
     conclusion – thus:

     Major Premise: Sixty men can do a piece of work sixty times as
     quickly as one man.

     Minor Premise: One man can dig a post-hole in sixty seconds;
     Therefore-
     Conclusion: Sixty men can dig a post-hole in one second.

     This may be called syllogism arithmetical, in which, by combining
     logic and mathematics, we obtain a double certainty and are twice
     blessed.

     Ambrose Bierce The Unabridged Devil’s Dictionary

   In mainstream economics, both logic and mathematics are used
   extensively. And most mainstream economists sure look upon themselves
   as “twice blessed.”

   Is there any scientific ground for that blessedness? None whatsoever!

   If scientific progress in economics lies in our ability to tell ‘better
   and better stories’ one would, of course, expect economics journals
   being filled with articles supporting the stories with empirical
   evidence confirming the predictions. However, the journals still show a
   striking and embarrassing paucity of empirical studies that (try to)
   substantiate these predictive claims. Equally amazing is how little one
   has to say about the relationship between the model and real-world
   target systems. It is as though explicit discussion, argumentation and
   justification on the subject aren’t considered to be required.

   In mathematics, the deductive-axiomatic method has worked just fine.
   But science is not mathematics. Conflating those two domains of
   knowledge has been one of the most fundamental mistakes made in modern
   economics. Applying it to real-world open systems immediately proves it
   to be excessively narrow and hopelessly irrelevant. Both the
   confirmatory and explanatory ilk of hypothetico-deductive reasoning
   fails since there is no way you can relevantly analyse confirmation or
   explanation as a purely logical relation between hypothesis and
   evidence or between law-like rules and explananda. In science, we argue
   and try to substantiate our beliefs and hypotheses with reliable
   evidence. Propositional and predicate deductive logic, on the other
   hand, is not about reliability, but the validity of the conclusions
   given that the premises are true.

   Deduction — and the inferences that go with it — is an example of
   ‘explicative reasoning,’ where the conclusions we make are already
   included in the premises. Deductive inferences are purely analytical
   and it is this truth-preserving nature of deduction that makes it
   different from all other kinds of reasoning. But it is also its
   limitation since truth in the deductive context does not refer to a
   real-world ontology (only relating propositions as true or false within
   a formal-logic system) and as an argument scheme is totally
   non-ampliative — the output of the analysis is nothing else than the
   input.

   If the ultimate criterion of success of a model is to what extent it
   predicts and coheres with (parts of) reality, modern mainstream
   economics seems to be a hopeless misallocation of scientific resources.
   To focus scientific endeavours on proving things in mathematical
   models, is a gross misapprehension of what an economic theory ought to
   be about. Deductivist models and methods disconnected from reality are
   not relevant to predict, explain or understand real-world economies.

   In science we standardly use a logically non-valid inference — the
   fallacy of affirming the consequent — of the following form:

   (1) p => q
   (2) q
   ————-
   p

   or, in instantiated form

   (1) ∀x (Gx => Px)

   (2) Pa
   ————
   Ga

   Although logically invalid, it is nonetheless (as already Charles S.
   Peirce argued more than a century ago) a kind of inference — abduction
   — that may be factually strongly warranted and truth-producing.

   64800990 Following the general pattern ‘Evidence  =>  Explanation  =>
   Inference’ we infer something based on what would be the best
   explanation given the law-like rule (premise 1) and an observation
   (premise 2). The truth of the conclusion (explanation) is nothing that
   is logically given, but something we have to justify, argue for, and
   test in different ways to possibly establish with any certainty or
   degree. And as always when we deal with explanations, what is
   considered best is relative to what we know of the world. In the real
   world all evidence has an irreducible holistic aspect. We never
   conclude that evidence follows from a hypothesis simpliciter, but
   always given some more or less explicitly stated contextual background
   assumptions. All non-deductive inferences and explanations are
   necessarily context-dependent.

   If we extend the abductive scheme to incorporate the demand that the
   explanation has to be the best among a set of plausible
   competing/rival/contrasting potential and satisfactory explanations, we
   have what is nowadays usually referred to as inference to the best
   explanation.

   In inference to the best explanation we start with a body of
   (purported) data/facts/evidence and search for explanations that can
   account for these data/facts/evidence. Having the best explanation
   means that you, given the context-dependent background assumptions,
   have a satisfactory explanation that can explain the fact/evidence
   better than any other competing explanation — and so it is reasonable
   to consider/believe the hypothesis to be true. Even if we (inevitably)
   do not have deductive certainty, our reasoning gives us a license to
   consider our belief in the hypothesis as reasonable.

   Accepting a hypothesis means that you believe it does explain the
   available evidence better than any other competing hypothesis. Knowing
   that we — after having earnestly considered and analysed the other
   available potential explanations — have been able to eliminate the
   competing potential explanations, warrants and enhances the confidence
   we have that our preferred explanation is the best explanation, i. e.,
   the explanation that provides us (given it is true) with the greatest
   understanding.

   This, of course, does not in any way mean that we cannot be wrong. Of
   course we can. Inferences to the best explanation are fallible
   inferences — since the premises do not logically entail the conclusion
   — so from a logical point of view, inference to the best explanation is
   a weak mode of inference. But if the arguments put forward are strong
   enough, they can be warranted and give us justified true belief, and
   hence, knowledge, even though they are fallible inferences. As
   scientists we sometimes — much like Sherlock Holmes and other
   detectives that use inference to the best explanation reasoning —
   experience disillusion. We thought that we had reached a strong
   conclusion by ruling out the alternatives in the set of contrasting
   explanations. But — what we thought was true turned out to be false.

   That does not necessarily mean that we had no good reasons for
   believing what we believed. If we cannot live with that contingency and
   uncertainty, well, then we are in the wrong business. If it is
   deductive certainty you are after, rather than the ampliative and
   defeasible reasoning in inference to the best explanation — well, then
   get in to math or logic, not science.

    1. According to Prof. Syll :
       “the best explanation means that you…have a satisfactory
       explanation that can explain the fact/evidence better than any
       other competing explanation”
       Sadly this is merely an uninteresting definition or tautology or
       circular reasoning.
       Of course we prefer the “best” theory rather than worse theories!
       .
       The difficult issues concern data and the criteria for deciding
       what is best.
       Prof. Syll gives no suggestions on these matters.
       Simplicity?
       Comprehensibility?
       Empirical Adequacy?
       Cognitive Fit?
       Explanatory power?
       Minimal changes in scientific belief compared with previously held
       theory? Intellectual pedigree?
       Aesthetic beauty?
       Consistency with political, philosophical and religious beliefs?
       Anti-racism?
       Wokeness?
       .
       How should we measure and weight such criteria? And who should
       decide such matters?
       Most scientists prefer inductive methods e.g. maximum likelihood
       given the available data.

    2. Explanations based on deductive reasoning, as Lars has voluminously
       explained, aren’t particularly helpful because they draw on
       assumptions which permit coherence, rigour and tractability rather
       than relevance to the real world.
       .
       Explanations based on abduction may be more useful but if the aim
       is prediction then an assumption that the system of interest is
       homogenous across time must be made. Otherwise, abduction is as
       useful as deductive reasoning.

    3. Dave, I think you misread me here. I certainly have no problem at
       all with mathematics or logic per se. That’s not what I am
       criticising. Far from it. But to insist on always applying
       mathematical-formalistic models and theories — as is standard in
       mainstream economics — and not seriously taking into consideration
       if they are suited for understanding and explaining things in the
       intended real-world target system is not an acceptable scientific
       procedure. And, further, even where they are applicable, the
       problem is that they usually do not take us very far, and that’s
       why I argue that it would be better to go for abduction rather than
       deduction when you want to make inferences about systems without
       the needed closures that the deductive kind of inferences
       presuppose.

    4. As a mathematician, I just don’t see how this helps. Taking Lars’
       last paragraph, isn’t logic relevant to science? And in so far as
       science is interested in mathematical structures (such as numbers)
       isn’t mathematics essential to science?
       In terms of the starting quote, I don’t see any problem. Isn’t the
       notion of a syllogism essential to science?
       Suppose we know that p implies q and that q is consistent with
       evidence e. Then we can conclude that p is also consistent with
       evidence e. Isn’t this how science works? (As distinct from
       applying the results of science ‘as if’ they were facts, which is a
       different subject.)
       This is very like Lars’ notion of abduction, but is strictly
       logical for any strictly logical interpretation of ‘implies’ and
       ‘evidence’. Lars wishes to go beyond abduction to ‘inference to the
       best explanation’. This could also be made logical, by having a
       logical definition of ‘best’. It seems to me that neoclassical
       economics could be reformulated in a way that meets Lars’
       requirements and is also logical (and mathematical): it is just
       that Lars (and I) might not accept their notion of ‘best’
       It seems to me that Lars draws our attention to an area that needs
       sorting out if economics (and much else) is to make progress, but I
       just don’t get how his ‘explanations’ help. My own explanation for
       the malaise in economics is that economists have tended not to
       understand how science works at its best, and have instead taken
       their lead from some inadequate understanding of science and hence
       a misuse of logic and a misinterpretation of mathematical results.
       This seems a better explanation (to me) than Lars’ view is that
       logic and maths per se are to blame. (But maybe the teaching of
       maths and logic are at fault?)

    5. I began my doctoral research into the limitations of formalist
       approaches to rationality by examining Imre Lakatos’ Proofs and
       Refutations, where he demonstrates that mathematical proofs are
       just as much subject to ceteris paribus clauses as science. More
       recently, George Lakoff’s Where Does Mathematics Come From is a
       more broad ranging exploration of the metaphoric structuring of
       mathematics, and the implications that has for mathematical
       reasoning. The biggest difference between mathematics and science
       is the centrality of causal reasoning in the latter, not the limits
       of deductive reasoning.
