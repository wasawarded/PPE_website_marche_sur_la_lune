Dynamic Many Valued Logic Systems in Theoretical Economics

   D. Lu

Abstract

   This paper is an original attempt to understand the foundations of
   economic reasoning. It endeavors to rigorously define the relationship
   between subjective interpretations and objective valuations of such
   interpretations in the context of theoretical economics. This analysis
   is substantially expanded through a dynamic approach, where the truth
   of a valuation results in an updated interpretation or changes in the
   agent's subjective belief regarding the effectiveness of the selected
   action as well as the objective reality of the effectiveness of all
   other possible actions (i.e. consequence realization). Complications
   arise when the economic agent is presented with a set of actions that
   render ambiguous preference, or when the effectiveness of an action
   cannot be perceived upon its selection, thereby necessitating a
   different theory of choice and consequence realization.
