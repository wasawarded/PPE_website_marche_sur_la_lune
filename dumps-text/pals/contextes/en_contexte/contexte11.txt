   Logic is the study of correct reasoning. It includes both formal and
   informal logic. Formal logic is the study of deductively valid
   inferences or logical truths. It examines how conclusions follow from
   premises based on the structure of arguments alone, independent of
   their topic and content. Informal logic is associated with informal
   fallacies, critical thinking, and argumentation theory. Informal logic
   examines arguments expressed in natural language whereas formal logic
   uses formal language. When used as a countable noun, the term "a logic"
   refers to a specific logical formal system that articulates a proof
   system. Logic plays a central role in many fields, such as philosophy,

   reasoning often embody fallacies. Systems of logic are theoretical
   frameworks for assessing the correctness of arguments.
--
   Logic has been studied since antiquity. Early approaches include
   Aristotelian logic, Stoic logic, Nyaya, and Mohism. Aristotelian logic
   focuses on reasoning in the form of syllogisms. It was considered the
   main system of logic in the Western world until it was replaced by
   modern formal logic, which has its roots in the work of late
   19th-century mathematicians such as Gottlob Frege. Today, the most
   commonly used system is classical logic. It consists of propositional
   logic and first-order logic. Propositional logic only considers logical
   relations between full propositions. First-order logic also takes the
   internal parts of propositions into account, like predicates and
   quantifiers. Extended logics accept the basic intuitions behind
   classical logic and apply it to other fields, such as metaphysics,
   ethics, and epistemology. Deviant logics, on the other hand, reject
   certain classical intuitions and provide alternative explanations of
   the basic laws of logic.

   conclusion.^[7] These general characterizations apply to logic in the
   widest sense, i.e., to both formal and informal logic since they are
   both concerned with assessing the correctness of arguments.^[8] Formal
   logic is the traditionally dominant field, and some logicians restrict
   logic to formal logic.^[9]

Formal logic

--

   Formal logic is also known as symbolic logic and is widely used in
   mathematical logic. It uses a formal approach to study reasoning: it
   replaces concrete expressions with abstract symbols to examine the
   logical form of arguments independent of their concrete content. In
   this sense, it is topic-neutral since it is only concerned with the
--

   Formal logic is interested in deductively valid arguments, for which
   the truth of their premises ensures the truth of their conclusion. This
   means that it is impossible for the premises to be true and the
   conclusion to be false.^[11] For valid arguments, the logical structure
   of the premises and the conclusion follows a pattern called a rule of
--
   (3) therefore q" are valid, independent of what the terms p and q stand
   for.^[13] In this sense, formal logic can be defined as the science of
   valid inferences. An alternative definition sees logic as the study of
   logical truths.^[14] A proposition is logically true if its truth
   depends only on the logical vocabulary used in it. This means that it
   is true in all possible worlds and under all interpretations of its
   non-logical terms, like the claim "either it is raining, or it is
   not".^[15] These two definitions of formal logic are not identical, but
   they are closely related. For example, if the inference from p to q is
   deductively valid then the claim "if p then q" is a logical truth.^[16]
   Visualization of how to translate an English sentence into first-order
   logic Formal logic needs to translate natural language arguments into a
   formal language, like first-order logic, to assess whether they are
   valid. In this example, the letter "c" represents Carmen while the

   Formal logic uses formal languages to express and analyze
   arguments.^[17] They normally have a very limited vocabulary and exact

   to construct sentences, so-called well-formed formulas.^[18] This
   simplicity and exactness of formal logic make it capable of formulating
   precise rules of inference. They determine whether a given argument is
--

   The term "logic" can also be used in a slightly different sense as a
   countable noun. In this sense, a logic is a logical formal system.
   Distinct logics differ from each other concerning the rules of
   inference they accept as valid and the formal languages used to express
--
   have been proposed. There are disagreements about what makes a formal
   system a logic.^[22] For example, it has been suggested that only
   logically complete systems, like first-order logic, qualify as logics.
   For such reasons, some theorists deny that higher-order logics are
   logics in the strict sense.^[23]

Informal logic

   [edit]
   Main article: Informal logic

   When understood in a wide sense, logic encompasses both formal and
   informal logic.^[24] Informal logic uses non-formal criteria and
   standards to analyze and assess the correctness of arguments. Its main
   focus is on everyday discourse.^[25] Its development was prompted by
   difficulties in applying the insights of formal logic to natural
   language arguments.^[26] In this regard, it considers problems that
   formal logic on its own is unable to address.^[27] Both provide
   criteria for assessing the correctness of arguments and distinguishing
--

   Many characterizations of informal logic have been suggested but there
   is no general agreement on its precise definition.^[29] The most
   literal approach sees the terms "formal" and "informal" as applying to
   the language used to express arguments. On this view, informal logic
   studies arguments that are in informal or natural language.^[30] Formal
   logic can only examine them indirectly by translating them first into a
   formal language while informal logic investigates them in their
   original form.^[31] On this view, the argument "Birds fly. Tweety is a
   bird. Therefore, Tweety flies." belongs to natural language and is
   examined by informal logic. But the formal translation "(1)
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <mstyle
--
   </semantics> :MATH]
   {\displaystyle Flies(Tweety)} " is studied by formal logic.^[32] The
   study of natural language arguments comes with various difficulties.
   For example, natural language expressions are often ambiguous, vague,
   and context-dependent.^[33] Another approach defines informal logic in
   a wide sense as the normative study of the standards, criteria, and
--

   Another characterization identifies informal logic with the study of
   non-deductive arguments. In this way, it contrasts with deductive
   reasoning examined by formal logic.^[35] Non-deductive arguments make
   their conclusion probable but do not ensure that it is true. An example
--

   A further approach is to define informal logic as the study of informal
   fallacies.^[37] Informal fallacies are incorrect arguments in which
--
   or against us; you are not with us; therefore, you are against
   us".^[39] Some theorists state that formal logic studies the general
   form of arguments while informal logic studies particular instances of
   arguments. Another approach is to hold that formal logic only considers
   the role of logical constants for correct inferences while informal
   logic also takes the meaning of substantive concepts into account.
   Further approaches focus on the discussion of logical topics with or
   without formal devices and on the role of epistemology for the
--
   Premises and conclusions are the basic parts of inferences or arguments
   and therefore play a central role in logic. In the case of a valid
   inference or a correct argument, the conclusion follows from the
--
   For instance, the premises "Mars is red" and "Mars is a planet" support
   the conclusion "Mars is a red planet". For most types of logic, it is
   accepted that premises and conclusions have to be
--
   on how it is interpreted.^[46] Another approach is to understand
   premises and conclusions in psychological terms as thoughts or
   judgments. This position is known as psychologism. It was discussed at
--
   Some complex propositions are true independently of the substantive
   meanings of their parts.^[53] In classical logic, for example, the
   complex proposition "either Mars is red or Mars is not red" is true
   independent of whether its parts, like the simple proposition "Mars is
   red", are true or false. In such cases, the truth is called a logical
   truth: a proposition is logically true if its truth depends only on the
   logical vocabulary used in it.^[54] This means that it is true under
   all interpretations of its non-logical terms. In some modal logics,
   this means that the proposition is true in all possible worlds.^[55]
   Some theorists define logic as the study of logical truths.^[16]

   the truth values of complex propositions depends on their parts. They

   are often used interchangeably in logic. Arguments are correct or

   Premises and conclusions, on the other hand, are true or false
   depending on whether they are in accord with reality. In formal logic,

--

   The main focus of most logicians is to study the criteria according to
   which an argument is correct or incorrect. A fallacy is committed if
   these criteria are violated. In the case of formal logic, they are
   known as rules of inference.^[93] They are definitory rules, which

   A formal system of logic consists of a formal language together with a

Systems of logic

--

   Systems of logic are theoretical frameworks for assessing the
   correctness of reasoning and arguments. For over two thousand years,
   Aristotelian logic was treated as the canon of logic in the Western
   world,^[104] but modern developments in this field have led to a vast
   proliferation of logical systems.^[105] One prominent categorization
   divides modern formal logical systems into classical logic, extended
   logics, and deviant logics.^[106]

--

   Main article: Aristotelian logic

   Aristotelian logic encompasses a great variety of topics. They include
   metaphysical theses about ontological categories and problems of
   scientific explanation. But in a more narrow sense, it is identical to
   term logic or syllogistics. A syllogism is a form of argument involving
   three propositions: two premises and a conclusion. Each proposition has
--
   "wise", and the copula "is".^[108] The subject and the predicate are
   the terms of the proposition. Aristotelian logic does not contain
   complex propositions made up of simple propositions. It differs in this
   aspect from propositional logic, in which any two propositions can be
   linked using a logical connective like "and" to form a new complex
   proposition.^[109]

   indefinite, or singular. For example, the term "all humans" is a

   Aristotelian logic only includes predicates for simple properties of
   entities. But it lacks predicates corresponding to relations between
--
   three predicates, referred to as major term, minor term, and middle
   term.^[114] The central aspect of Aristotelian logic involves
   classifying all possible syllogisms into valid and invalid arguments
--

   Main article: Classical logic

   Classical logic is distinct from traditional or Aristotelian logic. It
   encompasses propositional logic and first-order logic. It is
   "classical" in the sense that it is based on basic logical intuitions
   shared by most logicians.^[117] These intuitions include the law of
   excluded middle, the double negation elimination, the principle of
--
   to other fields as well. Because of this focus on mathematics, it does
   not include logical vocabulary relevant to many other topics of
   philosophical importance. Examples of concepts it overlooks are the
--
   between past, present, and future.^[119] Such issues are addressed by
   extended logics. They build on the basic intuitions of classical logic
   and expand it by introducing new logical vocabulary. This way, the
   exact logical approach is applied to fields like ethics or epistemology
   that lie beyond the scope of mathematics.^[120]

Propositional logic

--

   Propositional logic comprises formal systems in which formulae are
   built from atomic propositions using logical connectives. For instance,
   propositional logic represents the conjunction of two atomic
   propositions
--
   </semantics> :MATH]
   {\displaystyle P\land Q} . Unlike predicate logic where terms and
   predicates are the smallest units, propositional logic takes full
   propositions with truth values as its most basic component.^[121] Thus,
   propositional logics can only represent logical relationships that
   arise from the way complex propositions are built from simpler ones.
--

First-order logic

--

   Main article: First-order logic

   First-order logic includes the same propositional connectives as
   propositional logic but differs from it because it articulates the
   internal structure of propositions. This happens through devices such
--
   </semantics> :MATH]
   {\displaystyle \exists xB(x)} . First-order logic contains various
   rules of inference that determine how expressions articulated this way
--

   Extended logics are logical systems that accept the basic principles of
   classical logic. They introduce additional symbols and principles to
   apply it to fields like metaphysics, ethics, and epistemology.^[125]

Modal logic

--

   Main article: Modal logic

   Modal logic is an extension of classical logic. In its original form,
   sometimes called "alethic modal logic", it introduces two new symbols:
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <mstyle
--
   that Socrates is a banker".^[127] To include these symbols in the
   logical formalism, modal logic introduces new rules of inference that
   govern what role they play in inferences. One rule of inference states
--

   Other forms of modal logic introduce similar symbols but associate
   different meanings with them to apply modal logic to other fields. For
   example, deontic logic concerns the field of ethics and introduces
   symbols to express the ideas of obligation and permission, i.e. to
   describe whether an agent has to perform a certain action or is allowed
   to perform it.^[129] The modal operators in temporal modal logic
   articulate temporal relations. They can be used to express, for
   example, that something happened at one time or that something is
   happening all the time.^[129] In epistemology, epistemic modal logic is
   used to represent the ideas of knowing something in contrast to merely
--

Higher order logic

--

   Main article: Higher-order logic

   Higher-order logics extend classical logic not by using modal operators
   but by introducing new forms of quantification.^[131] Quantifiers
   correspond to terms like "all" or "some". In classical first-order
   logic, quantifiers are only applied to individuals. The formula "
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <mstyle
--
   </semantics> :MATH]
   {\displaystyle x} ". In higher-order logics, quantification is also
   allowed over predicates. This increases its expressive power. For
--
   of mathematical theories.^[43] But it has drawbacks in regard to its
   meta-logical properties and ontological implications, which is why
   first-order logic is still more commonly used.^[133]

--

   Main article: Deviant logic

   Deviant logics are logical systems that reject some of the basic
   intuitions of classical logic. Because of this, they are usually seen
   not as its supplements but as its rivals. Deviant logical systems
   differ from each other either because they reject different classical
--

   Intuitionistic logic is a restricted version of classical logic.^[135]
   It uses the same symbols but excludes some rules of inference. For
--
   {\displaystyle \lnot \lnot A} . This is a valid rule of inference in
   classical logic but it is invalid in intuitionistic logic. Another
   classical principle not part of intuitionistic logic is the law of
   excluded middle. It states that for every sentence, either it or its
--
   {\displaystyle A\lor \lnot A} is true.^[135] These deviations from
   classical logic are based on the idea that truth is established by
   verification using a proof. Intuitionistic logic is especially
   prominent in the field of constructive mathematics, which emphasizes
--

   Multi-valued logics depart from classicality by rejecting the principle
   of bivalence, which requires all propositions to be either true or
   false. For instance, Jan Łukasiewicz and Stephen Cole Kleene both
   proposed ternary logics which have a third truth value representing
   that a statement's truth value is indeterminate.^[137] These logics
   have been applied in the field of linguistics. Fuzzy logics are
   multivalued logics that have an infinite number of "degrees of truth",
   represented by a real number between 0 and 1.^[138]

   Paraconsistent logics are logical systems that can deal with
   contradictions. They are formulated to avoid the principle of

   Main article: Informal logic

   Informal logic is usually carried out in a less systematic way. It
   often focuses on more specific issues, like investigating a particular
   type of fallacy or studying a certain aspect of argumentation.
   Nonetheless, some frameworks of informal logic have also been presented
   that try to provide a systematic characterization of the correctness of

   The epistemic approach to informal logic, on the other hand, focuses on
   the epistemic role of arguments.^[148] It is based on the idea that

   fails to provide independent justification for its conclusion, even
   though it is deductively valid.^[151] In this sense, logical
   normativity consists in epistemic success or rationality.^[149] The

   to ethics or computer science.^[156] In other cases, logic itself is

   logicians. Other ways include interpreting and analyzing logic through
   mathematical structures as well as studying and comparing abstract
   properties of formal logical systems.^[157]

   Main articles: Philosophy of logic and Philosophical logic

   Philosophy of logic is the philosophical discipline studying the scope
   and nature of logic.^[59] It examines many presuppositions implicit in
   logic, like how to define its basic concepts or the metaphysical
   assumptions associated with them.^[158] It is also concerned with how
   to classify logical systems and considers the ontological commitments
   they incur.^[159] Philosophical logic is one of the areas within the
   philosophy of logic. It studies the application of logical methods to
   philosophical problems in fields like metaphysics, ethics, and
   epistemology.^[160] This application usually happens in the form of
   extended or deviant logical systems.^[161]

Metalogic

--

   Main article: Metalogic

   Metalogic is the field of inquiry studying the properties of formal
   logical systems. For example, when a new formal system is developed,
   metalogicians may study it to determine which formulas can be proven in
   it. They may also study whether an algorithm could be developed to find
   a proof for each formula and whether every provable formula in it is a
   tautology. Finally, they may compare it to other logical systems to
   understand its distinctive features. A key issue in metalogic concerns
   the relation between syntax and semantics. The syntactic rules of a
--
   argument is provable and whether every provable argument is valid.
   Metalogicians also study whether logical systems are complete, sound,
   and consistent. They are interested in whether the systems are
   decidable and what expressive power they have. Metalogicians usually
   rely heavily on abstract mathematical reasoning when examining and
   formulating metalogical proofs. This way, they aim to arrive at precise
   and general conclusions on these topics.^[162]

Mathematical logic

   Photograph of Bertrand Russell Bertrand Russell made various
   contributions to mathematical logic.^[163]

   The term "mathematical logic" is sometimes used as a synonym of "formal
   logic". But in a more restricted sense, it refers to the study of logic
   within mathematics. Major subareas include model theory, proof theory,
   set theory, and computability theory.^[164] Research in mathematical
   logic commonly addresses the mathematical properties of formal systems
   of logic. However, it can also include attempts to use logic to analyze
   mathematical reasoning or to establish logic-based foundations of
   mathematics.^[165] The latter was a major concern in early 20th-century
   mathematical logic, which pursued the program of logicism pioneered by
   philosopher-logicians such as Gottlob Frege, Alfred North Whitehead,
   and Bertrand Russell. Mathematical theories were supposed to be logical
   tautologies, and their program was to show this by means of a reduction
   of mathematics to logic. Many attempts to realize this program failed,

   Computational logic is the branch of logic and computer science that
   studies how to implement mathematical reasoning and logical formalisms

   intervention.^[169] Logic programming languages are designed
   specifically to express facts using logical formulas and to draw
   inferences from these facts. For example, Prolog is a logic programming
   language based on predicate logic.^[170] Computer scientists also apply
   concepts from logic to problems in computing. The works of Claude
   Shannon were influential in this regard. He showed how Boolean logic
   can be used to understand and implement computer circuits.^[171] This
   can be achieved using electronic logic gates, i.e. electronic circuits
   with one or more inputs and usually one output. The truth values of
   propositions are represented by voltage levels. In this way, logic
   functions can be simulated by applying the corresponding voltages to

   Formal semantics is a subfield of logic, linguistics, and the

   relation to truth conditions, i.e. it examines in which situations a
   sentence would be true or false. One of its central methodological
   assumptions is the principle of compositionality. It states that the

Epistemology of logic

--

   The epistemology of logic studies how one knows that an argument is
   valid or that a proposition is logically true.^[174] This includes
   questions like how to justify that modus ponens is a valid rule of
   inference or that contradictions are false.^[175] The traditionally
   dominant view is that this form of logical understanding belongs to
   knowledge a priori.^[176] In this regard, it is often argued that the
   mind has a special faculty to examine relations between pure ideas and
   that this faculty is also responsible for apprehending logical
   truths.^[177] A similar approach understands the rules of logic in
   terms of linguistic conventions. On this view, the laws of logic are
   trivial since they are true by definition: they just express the
   meanings of the logical vocabulary.^[178]

   Some theorists, like Hilary Putnam and Penelope Maddy, object to the
   view that logic is knowable a priori. They hold instead that logical
   truths depend on the empirical world. This is usually combined with the
   claim that the laws of logic express universal regularities found in
   the structural features of the world. According to this view, they may

   an empirical argument for the thesis that quantum logic is the correct
   logical system and should replace classical logic.^[179]

   syllogisms, and propositions. Aristotelian logic was highly regarded in
   classical and medieval times, both in Europe and the Middle East. It
--
   has now been superseded by later work, though many of its key insights
   are still present in modern systems of logic.^[188]

   Ibn Sina (Avicenna) was the founder of Avicennian logic, which replaced
   Aristotelian logic as the dominant system of logic in the Islamic
   world.^[189] It influenced Western medieval writers such as Albertus
--
   an original "temporally modalized" syllogistic theory, involving
   temporal logic and modal logic.^[193] He also made use of inductive
   logic, such as his methods of agreement, difference, and concomitant
   variation, which are critical to the scientific method.^[191] Fakhr
   al-Din al-Razi was another influential Muslim logician. He criticized
   Aristotelian syllogistics and formulated an early system of inductive
   logic, foreshadowing the system of inductive logic developed by John
   Stuart Mill.^[194]
--
   During the Middle Ages, many translations and interpretations of
   Aristotelian logic were made. The works of Boethius were particularly
   influential. Besides translating Aristotle's work into Latin, he also
   produced textbooks on logic.^[195] Later, the works of Islamic
   philosophers such as Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd (Averroes) were drawn on.
--
   William of Ockham's influential Summa Logicae was released. It is a
   comprehensive treatise on logic that discusses many basic concepts of
   logic and provides a systematic exposition of types of propositions and
   their truth conditions.^[196]
--
   which defends the thesis that a white horse is not a horse. The school
   of Mohism also acknowledged the importance of language for logic and
   tried to relate the ideas in these fields to the realm of ethics.^[197]

   In India, the study of logic was primarily pursued by the schools of
   Nyaya, Buddhism, and Jainism. It was not treated as a separate academic
--
   object.^[199] A similar emphasis on the relation to epistemology is
   also found in Buddhist and Jainist schools of logic, where inference is
   used to expand the knowledge gained through other sources.^[200] Some
   of the later theories of Nyaya, belonging to the Navya-Nyāya school,
   resemble modern forms of logic, such as Gottlob Frege's distinction
   between sense and reference and his definition of number.^[201]

   The syllogistic logic developed by Aristotle predominated in the West
   until the mid-19th century, when interest in the foundations of
   mathematics stimulated the development of modern symbolic logic.^[202]
   Many see Gottlob Frege's Begriffsschrift as the birthplace of modern
   logic. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's idea of a universal formal language
   is often considered a forerunner. Other pioneers were George Boole, who
   invented Boolean algebra as a mathematical system of logic, and Charles
   Peirce, who developed the logic of relatives. Alfred North Whitehead
   and Bertrand Russell, in turn, condensed many of these insights in
   their work Principia Mathematica. Modern logic introduced novel
   concepts, such as functions, quantifiers, and relational predicates. A
   hallmark of modern symbolic logic is its use of formal language to
   precisely codify its insights. In this regard, it departs from earlier
   logicians, who relied mainly on natural language.^[203] Of particular
   influence was the development of first-order logic, which is usually
   treated as the standard system of modern logic.^[204] Its analytical
   generality allowed the formalization of mathematics and drove the
--
   model theory possible and provided the foundation of modern
   mathematical logic.^[205]
