   Arguments that fall short of the standards of logical reasoning are
   called fallacies. For formal fallacies, like affirming the consequent,
   the error lies in the logical form of the argument. For informal
   fallacies, like false dilemmas, the source of the faulty reasoning is
   usually found in the content or the context of the argument. Some
   theorists understand logical reasoning in a wide sense that is roughly
   equivalent to critical thinking. In this regard, it encompasses

   The main discipline studying logical reasoning is called logic. It is
   divided into formal and informal logic, which study formal and informal
   logical reasoning.^[8]^[9]^[10] Traditionally, logical reasoning was
   primarily associated with deductive reasoning studied by formal
   logic.^[11] But in a wider sense, it also includes forms of
   non-deductive reasoning, such as inductive, abductive, and analogical
   reasoning.^[12]^[13]^[14]

   The forms of logical reasoning have in common that they use premises to
   make inferences in a norm-governed way. As norm-governed practices,
--
   norms, i.e. agreement about whether and to what degree the premises
   support their conclusion. The types of logical reasoning differ
   concerning the exact norms they use as well as the certainty of the

   case for well-researched issues in the empirical sciences.^[1]^[16]
   Some theorists give a very wide definition of logical reasoning that
   includes its role as a cognitive skill responsible for high-quality

   A variety of basic concepts is used in the study and analysis of
   logical reasoning. Logical reasoning happens by inferring a conclusion
   from a set of premises.^[3] Premises and conclusions are normally seen

   the terms "argument" and "inference" are often used interchangeably in
   logic. The purpose of arguments is to convince a person that something
   is the case by providing reasons for this belief.^[25]^[26] Many

   inference is a scheme of drawing conclusions that depends only on the
   logical form of the premises and the conclusion but not on their
   specific content.^[39]^[40] The most-discussed rule of inference is the

   The rules governing deductive reasoning are often expressed formally as
   logical systems for assessing the correctness of deductive arguments.
   Aristotelian logic is one of the earliest systems and was treated as
   the canon of logic in the Western world for over two thousand years. It
   is based on syllogisms, like concluding that "Socrates is a mortal"
--
   mortal".^[44]^[45]^[46] The currently dominant system is known as
   classical logic and covers many additional forms of inferences besides
   syllogisms. So-called extended logics are based on classical logic and
   introduce additional rules of inference for specific domains. For
   example, modal logic can be used to reason about what is possible and
   what is necessary. Temporal logic can be used to draw inferences about
   what happened before, during, and after an event.^[47]^[48]^[49]
   Classical logic and its extensions rest on a set of basic logical
   intuitions accepted by most logicians. They include the law of excluded
   middle, the double negation elimination, the principle of explosion,
   and the bivalence of truth.^[50] So-called deviant logics reject some
   of these basic intuitions and propose alternative rules governing the
   validity of arguments.^[44]^[51]^[52] For example, intuitionistic
   logics reject the law of excluded middle and the double negation
   elimination while paraconsistent logics reject the principle of
   explosion.^[52]^[53]^[54]

   and includes the capacity to select and apply the appropriate rules of
   logic to specific situations.^[110] It encompasses a great variety of
   abilities besides drawing conclusions from premises. Examples are to

   careful evaluation and contrasts in this regard with uncritical snap
   judgments and gut feelings.^[17] Other core skills linked to logical
   reasoning are to assess reasons before accepting a claim and to search

   responsible for logical reasoning can be learned, trained, and

   regard, logical reasoning should be skeptical and open-minded at the

   On the practical level, logical reasoning concerns the issue of making
   rational and effective decisions.^[114]^[115] For many real-life

   Time also plays a central role in logical reasoning.^[124] If one lacks
   important information, it is often better to delay a decision and look
   for new information before coming to a conclusion.^[111] If the
   decision is time-sensitive, on the other hand, logical reasoning may
   imply making a fast decision based on the currently available evidence
   even if it is very limited. For example, if a friend yells "Duck!"
   during a baseball game the most logical response may be to blindly
   trust them and duck instead of demanding an explanation or
