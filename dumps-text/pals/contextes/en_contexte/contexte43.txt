2. Six central methodological problems

   Although the different branches and schools of economics raise a wide
   variety of epistemological and ontological issues concerning economics,
   six problems have been central to methodological reflection (in this
   philosophical sense) concerning economics:
--
   economics bears on and may be influenced by normative concerns raises
   methodological questions about the relationships between a positive
   science concerning “facts” and a normative inquiry into values and what
--
   interests. Since economic theories bear so centrally on people’s
   interests, there are bound to be ideological biases at work in the
   discipline (Marx 1867, Preface). Positive and normative are especially

   and accounts of the reasons for their choices. See also the entries on
   methodological individualism and reasons for action: justification,
   motivation, explanation.

   economic equilibrium. In the anti-metaphysical intellectual environment
   of the 1930s and 1940s (of which logical positivism was at least
   symptomatic), any mention of causation became suspicious, and
--

   As mentioned in the previous section, the most important methodological
   issue concerning economics involves the very considerable
--
   false generalizations? If these claims are not universal
   generalizations, then what is their logical form? And how can claims
   that appear in this way to be false or approximate be tested and
   confirmed or disconfirmed? These problems have bedeviled economists and
   economic methodologists from the first methodological reflections to
   the present day.

   contingencies of policy and history (Roscher 1874, Schmoller 1888,
   1898), Mill’s methodological views dominated the mainstream of economic
   theory for a century (for example, Cairnes 1875). Mill’s vision

   in the 1870s and is clearly discernible in the most important
   methodological treatises concerning neoclassical economics, such as
   John Neville Keynes’ The Scope and Method of Political Economy (1891)
   or Lionel Robbins’ An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic
   Science (1932). Hausman (1992) argues that current methodological
   practice closely resembles Mill’s methodology, despite the fact that
--
   is coherent and conforms to an old-fashioned empiricist philosophy of
   science that finds the nomological force of generalizations in their
   universality, it is not faithful to the way in which economists see
--
   Over the last two decades there has been a surge of experimentation in
   economics, and Friedman’s methodological views probably do not command
   the same near unanimity that they used to. But they are still
--
   customizing a model from this collection. Is the ubiquity of talk of
   models just a change in terminological fashion, or does the concern
   with models (which is by no means unique to economics) signal a
   methodological shift? What are models? These questions have been
   discussed by Cartwright 1989, 1999, Godfrey Smith 2006, Grüne-Yanoff

   logical implications of the axioms that define the model are never
   disappointed. This is not to say that the logical investigation of
   models never results in surprises. Humans are not logically omniscient,
   and discovering the implications of a set of axioms may be an arduous

   methodological approaches and applies its conclusions to many schools
   and branches of economics. Much of the literature has focused on the

   rapidly increasing role of empirical and experimental inquiries in the
   day-to-day work of economists have seen echoes in methodological
   inquiries (Backhouse 2010). Since 1985, there has been a journal

   Methodology. This section will sample some of the methodological
   approaches of the past two decades.

   falsificationist methodology (1968, 1969). Scientists should formulate
   theories that are “logically falsifiable” — that is, inconsistent with
   some possible observation reports. “All crows are black” is logically
   falsifiable; it is inconsistent with (and would be falsified by) an
--
   (since it has thus far survived testing). Popper has defended what he
   calls “situational logic” (which is basically rational choice theory)
   as the correct method for the social sciences (1967, 1976). There
   appear to be serious tensions between Popper’s falsificationism and his
   defense of situational logic, and his discussion of situational logic
   has not been as influential as his falsificationism. For discussion of
   how situational logic applies to economics, see Hands (1985a).

--
   theories and models are almost all unfalsifiable, and if they were, the
   widespread acceptance of Friedman’s methodological views would insure
   that they are not subjected to serious test. When models apparently
--
   derive testable implications (Caldwell 1984). But this response ignores
   Popper’s insistence that testing requires methodological decisions not
   to attribute failures of predictions to mistakes in subsidiary

   These problems arise generally, and Popper proposes that they be solved
   by a methodological decision to regard a failure of the deduced
   testable implication to be a failure of the theory. But in economics
   the subsidiary assumptions are dubious and in many cases known to be
   false. Making the methodological decision that Popper requires is
   unreasonable and would lead one to reject all economic theories.

   justify relying on it in theoretical studies or for policy purposes
   would be making the methodological “error” of supposing that there can
   be evidence in support of hypotheses. With the notable exception of

   One radical reaction to the difficulties of justifying the reliance on
   severe simplifications is to deny that economics passes methodological
   muster. Alexander Rosenberg (1992) maintains that economics can only

   An equally radical but opposite reaction is Deirdre McCloskey’s, who
   denies that there are any non-trivial methodological standards that
   economics must meet (1985, 1992, 1994, 2000, McCloskey and Ziliak 2003,

   Throughout its history, economics has been the subject of sociological
   as well as methodological scrutiny. Many sociological discussions of
   economics, like Marx’s critique of classical political economy, have
   been concerned to identify ideological distortions and thereby to
   criticize particular aspects of economic theory and economic policy.
