   How to leverage logic programming to enhance data-driven development

--
   In a previous post we have seen how datalog language - and consequently
   logic programming - can be convenient in the context of data querying
   and exploration.

   We will now see how logic programming can be helpful in the context of
   data transformation. Let's first have a deeper look at logic
   programming concepts.
--
   Logic programming is a programming paradigm that is based on formal
   logic. In logic programming, programs are written in the form of
   logical statements or rules, which define relationships and constraints
   between different entities.
--
   object-oriented programming, which focus on how to achieve a specific
   task, logic programming is concerned with representing and reasoning
   about knowledge.

   Programs written in a logic programming language mainly consist of a
   set of facts, rules and queries.
--
   Logic programming is particularly suited to problems that can be
   represented as logical relationships. For example, logic programming
   can be used to solve inference, reasoning, and planning problems.
--

   Here are the key features of the logic programming paradigm.
     * Declarative Style: Logic programming is declarative, meaning that
       you specify what you want to achieve rather than how to achieve it.
     * Logic Rules: Programs consist of a set of logical rules or clauses.
       These rules are expressed in the form of predicates and facts,
       which represent relationships between objects or conditions.
     * Pattern Matching: The evaluation of logical statements often
       involves pattern matching. The system matches the input against the
       logical rules to determine if they apply.
     * Knowledge Representation: Uses a formal language that is precise
--
       it valuable for applications that require a deep understanding of
       data and the ability to make logical deductions.
     * Backtracking: Logic programming often involves a mechanism called
--

   Here are some generic examples of how logic programming can be used:
     * To represent knowledge about the real world, such as relationships
--
       problems or to draw conclusions.
     * To generate code, for example to translate logical rules into
       programming instructions.

When to use logic programming ?

--

   Being declarative means that logic programs focus on what the program
   should do, rather than how it should do it, making them easier to
--

   Furthermore, logic programs are expressive, allowing them to represent
   complex and abstract concepts in a concise and natural way.

   Additionally, logic programs are flexible and can accommodate different
   modes of execution, such as forward chaining or backward chaining which
--
   processing and analysis. Its ability to represent complex relationships
   and perform logical reasoning can help extracting meaningful
   information from vast amounts of data.

   We have seen logic programming offers a powerful approach for tasks
   that require extensive knowledge representation, reasoning, and

   Functional programming and logic programming are both declarative
   programming paradigms that offer unique strengths and applications.

   While functional programming and logic programming are two distinct
   programming paradigms, there are areas of overlap and potential
--

   Despite the fact functional and logic programming have distinct design
   principles, their combination or integration can lead to powerful and
--
   Therefore, librairies and frameworks of functional languages that
   incorporate features from logic paradigm (pattern-matching,
   logic-rules) such as datascript which is based on datalog and prolog
   principles, continue to be developed and may be very good options to

   See below 3 libraries which incorporates features of logic programming.
   Each of them offers a different level of abstraction.

1. Core.logic

   A low-level logic programming library for Clojure & ClojureScript.
   core.logic offers Prolog-like relational programming, constraint logic
   programming, and nominal logic programming for Clojure.

   Meander is a declarative data manipulation toolset created as a library
   in Clojure. Borrowing ideas from logic programming and term rewriting,
   Meander allows declarative descriptions of arbitrarily complex data;
--
   These different implementations make it possible to incorporate
   principles of logic programming into more global projects based on
   versatile and commonly used programming languages.
--

   Let's now address the question of using logic programming concepts in a
   concrete use-case.
--
   The approach based on the Meander library allows to pass all the
   business logic in more a declarative form, for all the rules for
   pattern-matching and transformation.
--
   which, once isolated from the rest of the code, represents a kind of
   predicate-as-data for declaring all the business logic of the solution.

   In summary, today I take advantage of the joint use of the native
   functionalities of Clojure and some features taken from the logical
   programming paradigm ; The best of both worlds.

   While logic programming offers a unique and powerful approach to
   problem-solving, it is not without its limitations and challenges. Here
   are some of the caveats of logic programming that should be considered
   when evaluating its suitability for a specific project:
--
       expensive, especially for complex problems with large knowledge
       bases. The search for solutions through logical inference can
       become time-consuming, particularly in cases where multiple
--
       large-scale applications.
     * Debugging Complexity: Debugging logic programs can be challenging
       due to their declarative nature and the non-deterministic execution
--
       time-consuming and may require a deep understanding of the
       underlying logic and search strategies.

--

   Despite these caveats, logic programming remains a valuable tool for a
   variety of applications, particularly those that require knowledge
--
   Careful consideration of these limitations and understanding the
   strengths of logic programming are crucial for making informed
   decisions about its suitability for specific projects.

   To date, the timely use of functionalities taken from logic programming
   has made it possible to considerably improve the maintainability of my
