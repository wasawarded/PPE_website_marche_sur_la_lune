   Provides students with a broad understanding of the fundamental
   concepts of computing, logic, and data processing. Concepts include
   introductory hardware and software architecture, models of computation,
   representation of data, machine arithmetic, assembler programming,
   command line interfaces, and an introduction to some of the logical and
   mathematical ideas used in computing.
