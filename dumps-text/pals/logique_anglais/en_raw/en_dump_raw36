   A logic analyzer is an electronic instrument that captures and displays
   multiple logic signals from a digital system or digital circuit. A
   logic analyzer may convert the captured data into timing diagrams,
   protocol decodes, state machine traces, opcodes, or may correlate
   opcodes with source-level software. Logic analyzers have advanced
   triggering capabilities, and are useful when a user needs to see the
   timing relationships between many signals in a digital system.^[1]

Overview

   [edit]

   Presently, there are three distinct categories of logic analyzers
   available on the market:
     * Modular LAs, which consist of both a chassis or mainframe and logic
       analyzer modules.^[2] The mainframe/chassis contains the display,
       controls, control computer, and multiple slots into which the
       actual data-capturing hardware is installed. The modules each have
       a specific number of channels, and multiple modules may be combined
       to obtain a very high channel count. While modular logic analyzers
       are typically more expensive, the ability to combine multiple
       modules to obtain a high channel count and the generally higher
       performance of modular logic analyzers often justifies the price.
       For the very high end modular logic analyzers, the user often must
       provide their own host PC or purchase an embedded controller
       compatible with the system.^[3]

     * Portable LAs,^[4] sometimes referred to as standalone LAs. Portable
       logic analyzers integrate everything into a single package, with
       options installed at the factory. While portable logic analyzers
       generally have lower performance than their modular counterparts,
       they are often used for general purpose debugging by cost conscious
       users.
     * PC-based LAs. The hardware connects to a computer through a USB or
       Ethernet connection and relays the captured signals to the software
       on the computer. These devices are typically much smaller and less
       expensive because they make use of a PC's existing keyboard,
       display and CPU.

Operation

   [edit]

   A logic analyzer can be triggered on a complicated sequence of digital
   events, then capture a large amount of digital data from the system
   under test (SUT).

   When logic analyzers first came into use, it was common to attach
   several hundred "clips" to a digital system. Later, specialized
   connectors came into use. The evolution of logic analyzer probes has
   led to a common footprint that multiple vendors support, which provides
   added freedom to end users. Introduced in April, 2002, connectorless
   technology (identified by several vendor-specific trade names:
   Compression Probing; Soft Touch; D-Max) has become popular. These
   probes provide a durable, reliable mechanical and electrical connection
   between the probe and the circuit board with less than 0.5 to 0.7 pF
   loading per signal.

   Once the probes are connected, the user programs the analyzer with the
   names of each signal, and can group several signals together for easier
   manipulation. Next, a capture mode is chosen, either "timing" mode,
   where the input signals are sampled at regular intervals based on an
   internal or external clock source, or "state" mode, where one or more
   of the signals are defined as "clocks", and data are taken on the
   rising or falling edges of these clocks, optionally using other signals
   to qualify these clocks.

   After the mode is chosen, a trigger condition must be set. A trigger
   condition can range from simple (such as triggering on a rising or
   falling edge of a single signal) to the very complex (such as
   configuring the analyzer to decode the higher levels of the TCP/IP
   stack and triggering on a certain HTTP packet).

   At this point, the user sets the analyzer to "run" mode, either
   triggering once, or repeatedly triggering.

   Once the data are captured, they can be displayed several ways, from
   the simple (showing waveforms or state listings) to the complex
   (showing decoded Ethernet protocol traffic). Some analyzers can also
   operate in a "compare" mode, where they compare each captured data set
   to a previously recorded data set, and halt capture or visually notify
   the operator when this data set is either matched or not. This is
   useful for long-term empirical testing. Recent analyzers can even be
   set to email a copy of the test data to the engineer on a successful
   trigger.

Uses

   [edit]

   Many digital designs, including those of ICs, are simulated to detect
   defects before the unit is constructed. The simulation usually provides
   logic analysis displays. Often, complex discrete logic is verified by
   simulating inputs and testing outputs using boundary scan. Logic
   analyzers can uncover hardware defects that are not found in
   simulation. These problems are typically too difficult to model in
   simulation, or too time-consuming to simulate and often cross multiple
   clock domains.

   Field-programmable gate arrays have become a common measurement point
   for logic analyzers and are also used to debug the logic circuit.

   Logic Analyzers are also very useful when it comes to analyze serial
   protocols, like I2C, SPI or UART, as they allow to capture long logic
   sequences showing one or several communication frames. Usually, the
   Logic Analyzer software will also interpret the protocol layer, making
   debugging of firmware less tedious task.

History

   [edit]

   As digital computing and integrated circuits emerged in the 1960s,^[5]
   new and difficult problems began to arise, problems that oscilloscopes
   had trouble handling. For the first time in computing history, it
   became essential to simultaneously view large numbers of signals. Early
   solutions attempted to combine hardware from multiple oscilloscopes
   into one package, but screen clutter, a lack of definite data
   interpretation, as well as probing constraints made this solution only
   marginally usable.

   The HP 5000A Logic Analyzer, introduced in the October 1973 issue of
   the Hewlett-Packard Journal, was probably the first commercially
   available instrument to be called a "Logic Analyzer". However, the HP
   5000A was limited to two channels and presented information by means of
   two rows of 32 LEDs. The first truly parallel instrument was the twelve
   channel HP 1601L, it was a plug-in for the HP 180 series oscilloscope
   mainframes and used the oscilloscope screen to present 16 rows of 12
   bit words as 1s and 0s. It was introduced in the January 1974
   Hewlett-Packard Journal.^[6]

Mixed-signal oscilloscopes

   [edit]

   Mixed-signal oscilloscopes combine the functionality of a digital
   storage oscilloscope with a logic analyzer. The several benefits of
   these include the ability to view analog and digital signals together
   in time, and to trigger on either digital or analog signals and capture
   on the other. A few limitations of mixed signal oscilloscopes are that
   they do not capture state-mode data, they have a limited channel count,
   and do not provide the analytical depth and insight of a logic
   analyzer.
