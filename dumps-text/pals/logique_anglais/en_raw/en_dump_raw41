   Lean Logic: A Dictionary for the Future and How to Survive It
   the late Dr. David Fleming
   LeanLogic.online, 2020
   Level: beginner
   Perspectives: Behavioral Economics, Complexity Economics, Ecological
   Economics, Evolutionary Economics, Other
   Topic: (De-)growth, Globalization & International Economic Relations,
   Reflection of Economics, Social movements & Transformation
   Format: Website
   Link: https://leanlogic.online/

   From the publisher: Lean Logic is the late David Fleming’s masterpiece,
   the product of more than thirty years’ work and a testament to the
   creative brilliance of one of Britain’s most important intellectuals. A
   dictionary unlike any other, it leads readers through Fleming’s
   stimulating exploration of fields as diverse as culture, history,
   science, art, logic, ethics, myth, economics, and anthropology, being
   made up of four hundred and four engaging essay-entries covering topics
   such as Boredom, Community, Debt, Growth, Harmless Lunatics, Land, Lean
   Thinking, Nanotechnology, Play, Religion, Spirit, Trust, and Utopia.
   The threads running through every entry are Fleming’s deft and original
   analysis of how our present market-based economy is destroying the very
   foundations—ecological, economic, and cultural— on which it depends,
   and his core focus: a compelling, grounded vision for a cohesive
   society that might weather the consequences. A society that provides a
   satisfying, culturally-rich context for lives well lived, in an economy
   not reliant on the impossible promise of eternal economic growth. A
   society worth living in. Worth fighting for. Worth contributing to. The
   beauty of the dictionary format is that it allows Fleming to draw
   connections without detracting from his in-depth exploration of each
   topic. Each entry carries intriguing links to other entries, inviting
   the enchanted reader to break free of the imposed order of a
   conventional book, starting where she will and following the links in
   the order of her choosing. In combination with Fleming’s refreshing
   writing style and good-natured humor, it also creates a book perfectly
   suited to dipping in and out. The decades Fleming spent honing his
   life’s work are evident in the lightness and mastery with which Lean
   Logic draws on an incredible wealth of cultural and historical
   learning—from Whitman to Whitefield, Dickens to Daly, Kropotkin to
   Kafka, Keats to Kuhn, Oakeshott to Ostrom, Jung to Jensen, Machiavelli
   to Mumford, Mauss to Mandelbrot, Leopold to Lakatos, Polanyi to Putnam,
   Nietzsche to Næss, Keynes to Kumar, Scruton to Shiva, Thoreau to
   Toynbee, Rabelais to Rogers, Shakespeare to Schumacher, Locke to
   Lovelock, Homer to Homer-Dixon—in demonstrating that many of the
   principles it commends have a track-record of success long pre-dating
   our current society. Fleming acknowledges, with honesty, the challenges
   ahead, but rather than inducing despair, Lean Logic is rare in its
   ability to inspire optimism in the creativity and intelligence of
   humans to nurse our ecology back to health; to rediscover the
   importance of place and play, of reciprocity and resilience, and of
   community and culture.

   South Africa’s taxi industry was established by black people in the
   1930s and has faced numerous challenges, including those posed by
   decades of apartheid laws. Covid-19 has highlighted contemporary
   challenges facing the industry and has also raised questions about how
   it can keep ‘driving forward’. This podcast explores questions such as
   what changes need to be made, and who can be the ‘drivers’ of such
   change.

   As the Covid-19 fueled economic downturn begins to intensify this
   winter, an extended study of the Italian cooperative sector’s
   historical resilience in times of crisis can serve as a learning
   experience for other countries seeking to create policies that foster
   more stable economies, with job security, care for marginalized
   communities and adequate counter-cyclical policies. Particularly, the
   Italian cooperative sector’s contributions to three aspects should be
   noted in closing. Firstly, the innovative phenomenon of cooperative
   enterprises has contributed to social inclusion of immigrant
   communities, the activation of youth, the unemployed and people with
   disabilities, a true compensation for both a market and state failure.
   Secondly, they have contributed to a reduction in income and wealth
   inequalities at a time when the issue of inequality is of global
   significance. Thirdly, the Italian cooperative movement has helped
   local communities revitalize in the face of demographic shifts and
   rendered them more resilient to the ravages of globalization. Each of
   these in their own right is a remarkable achievement.

   Keen first compares neoclassical approaches to modelling with heterodox
   ones. Then he discusses in length the required assumptions and the
   inconsistencies of the aggregate demand and supply model, which is
   extrapolated from a micro perspective. At the end some dynamic models
   with feedback mechanisms are shown.
