   In a previous post we have seen how datalog language - and consequently
   logic programming - can be convenient in the context of data querying
   and exploration.

   We will now see how logic programming can be helpful in the context of
   data transformation. Let's first have a deeper look at logic
   programming concepts.

What-is Logic Programming ?

   Logic programming is a programming paradigm that is based on formal
   logic. In logic programming, programs are written in the form of
   logical statements or rules, which define relationships and constraints
   between different entities.

   Unlike other programming paradigms, such as functional programming and
   object-oriented programming, which focus on how to achieve a specific
   task, logic programming is concerned with representing and reasoning
   about knowledge.

   Programs written in a logic programming language mainly consist of a
   set of facts, rules and queries.

   Facts describe the problem data, while rules describe the relationships
   between the data. Queries are statements or questions posed to the
   system that express a goal or a condition that needs to be satisfied.
Facts:
- John is a parent of Jim
- John is a parent of Ann
- Mary is a parent of Jim
- Mary is a parent of Ann
- John is a male
- Mary is a female

Rules:
- A person is a father if they are a parent and male.
- A person is a mother if they are a parent and female.
- Two individuals are siblings if they share the same parent.

Queries:
- Is John the father of Jim? => yes
- Are Jim and Ann siblings? => yes
- Is Mary the mother of Jim? => yes

   Logic programming is particularly suited to problems that can be
   represented as logical relationships. For example, logic programming
   can be used to solve inference, reasoning, and planning problems.

   This makes it well-suited for applications that require a deep
   understanding of complex domains, such as natural language processing
   or expert systems.

Building Blocks

   Here are the key features of the logic programming paradigm.
     * Declarative Style: Logic programming is declarative, meaning that
       you specify what you want to achieve rather than how to achieve it.
     * Logic Rules: Programs consist of a set of logical rules or clauses.
       These rules are expressed in the form of predicates and facts,
       which represent relationships between objects or conditions.
     * Pattern Matching: The evaluation of logical statements often
       involves pattern matching. The system matches the input against the
       logical rules to determine if they apply.
     * Knowledge Representation: Uses a formal language that is precise
       and unambiguous. This allows for clear and concise descriptions of
       complex relationships and concepts.
     * Reasoning and Inference: The interpreter can use the knowledge base
       to draw conclusions, solve problems, and answer queries. This makes
       it valuable for applications that require a deep understanding of
       data and the ability to make logical deductions.
     * Backtracking: Logic programming often involves a mechanism called
       backtracking. If a particular path of inference does not lead to a
       solution, the system can backtrack and explore alternative paths.

Application Domains

   Here are some generic examples of how logic programming can be used:
     * To represent knowledge about the real world, such as relationships
       between objects or properties of objects.
     * To reason about this knowledge, for example to find solutions to
       problems or to draw conclusions.
     * To generate code, for example to translate logical rules into
       programming instructions.

   Here are some specific domains of application:
     * Artificial Intelligence: Logic programming is a fundamental
       building block of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. It's
       used in various AI applications, including symbolic reasoning,
       machine learning, and knowledge engineering.
     * Natural Language Processing: Logic programming is used in natural
       language processing (NLP) applications to analyze and understand
       human language. It helps in tasks like machine translation, text
       summarization, and question answering.
     * Expert Systems: Logic programming plays a crucial role in building
       expert systems, which are computer programs that emulate human
       expertise in a specific domain. It helps in representing domain
       knowledge, reasoning about complex problems, and providing expert
       advice.
     * Database Management Systems: Logic programming is integrated into
       some database management systems (DBMS) to provide advanced query
       capabilities and knowledge-based features. It helps in handling
       complex queries, managing meta-data, and performing data mining
       tasks.
     * Verification and Validation: Logic programming is used in
       verification and validation of data consistency to ensure its
       correctness and adherence to specifications. It helps in
       formalizing requirements, and identifying potential errors.

When to use logic programming ?

   Logic programming has several advantages that it may be advisable to
   exploit in certain situations.

   Being declarative means that logic programs focus on what the program
   should do, rather than how it should do it, making them easier to
   understand, maintain, and modify.

   Furthermore, logic programs are expressive, allowing them to represent
   complex and abstract concepts in a concise and natural way.

   Additionally, logic programs are flexible and can accommodate different
   modes of execution, such as forward chaining or backward chaining which
   are especially useful in rules-engines.

Data-driven architecture

   The Data-Driven approach provides several benefits that contribute to
   the flexibility, adaptability, and efficiency of a system. However it
   often poses problems of efficiency in terms of developments as
   structures become more complex and the diversity of models increases.

     Working with complex data structures is like navigating a dense
     jungle: the built-in tools are your machete, but youll often need a
     bit of hacking and slashing to find your way through.

   Logic programming can significantly enhance data-driven architectures
   by providing a declarative and knowledge-driven approach to data
   processing and analysis. Its ability to represent complex relationships
   and perform logical reasoning can help extracting meaningful
   information from vast amounts of data.

   Logic programming offers a powerful and versatile approach that makes
   it a valuable tool for extracting information from data and enabling
   knowledge-driven decision-making.

Synergy with functional programming

   We have seen logic programming offers a powerful approach for tasks
   that require extensive knowledge representation, reasoning, and
   inference.

   On its end, the functional programming emphasizes the concept of pure
   functions, which are functions that take input values and produce
   output values without any side effects. This means that a function's
   output depends solely on its input, and it does not modify any external
   state or data.
     * Immutability: Data is treated as immutable, meaning it cannot be
       changed once created. This ensures data integrity and simplifies
       reasoning about program behavior.
     * Expression-oriented: Programs are composed of expressions that
       evaluate to values, rather than statements that modify state. This
       emphasizes the declarative nature of functional programming.
     * Higher-order functions: Functions can take other functions as
       arguments or return functions as results. This allows for powerful
       abstractions and concise code.

   Functional programming and logic programming are both declarative
   programming paradigms that offer unique strengths and applications.
   Feature Functional Programming Logic Programming
   Program Structure Functions as the primary building blocks Facts and
   rules as the foundation
   Data Paradigm Immutable data Mutable data
   Programming Style Declarative and expression-oriented Declarative and
   knowledge-driven
   Strengths Modularity, predictability, testability Knowledge
   representation, reasoning, inference
   Applications Web development, data processing Natural language
   processing, expert systems

Taking the best of both worlds

   While functional programming and logic programming are two distinct
   programming paradigms, there are areas of overlap and potential
   synergies between them.
     * Declarative Style: Functional Programming emphasizes a declarative
       style, where programs are written as a series of mathematical-like
       expressions. Logic Programming also follows a declarative style,
       where programs describe relationships and constraints rather than a
       sequence of steps.
     * Expressiveness: Leveraging the expressiveness of both paradigms can
       lead to more concise and expressive programs, especially in domains
       involving complex relationships and constraints.

   Despite the fact functional and logic programming have distinct design
   principles, their combination or integration can lead to powerful and
   expressive programming models.

   Therefore, librairies and frameworks of functional languages that
   incorporate features from logic paradigm (pattern-matching,
   logic-rules) such as datascript which is based on datalog and prolog
   principles, continue to be developed and may be very good options to
   consider.

A closer look to Clojure Libraries

   Let's now dive into implementations in the clojure ecosystem

   See below 3 libraries which incorporates features of logic programming.
   Each of them offers a different level of abstraction.

1. Core.logic

   A low-level logic programming library for Clojure & ClojureScript.
   core.logic offers Prolog-like relational programming, constraint logic
   programming, and nominal logic programming for Clojure.
 (run* [q]
   (membero q [1 2 3])
   (membero q [2 3 4]))

2. Meander

   Meander is a declarative data manipulation toolset created as a library
   in Clojure. Borrowing ideas from logic programming and term rewriting,
   Meander allows declarative descriptions of arbitrarily complex data;
   enabling you to search, match, remember, join, and transform any part
   of your data directly.
(defn favorite-food-info [foods-by-name user]
(m/match {:user user
          :foods-by-name foods-by-name}
  {:user
   {:name ?name
    :favorite-food {:name ?food}}
   :foods-by-name {?food {:popularity ?popularity
                          :calories ?calories}}}
  {:name ?name
   :favorite {:food ?food
              :popularity ?popularity
              :calories ?calories}}))

3. Clara rules

   Clara-rules is a forward-chaining rules engine written in
   Clojure(Script) with Java interoperability. It aims to simplify code
   with a developer-centric approach to expert systems. It implements an
   higher order machine.
;; Fact
[?person <- Person (= first-name "Alice") (= ?last-name last-name)]

;; rule
(defrule is-older-than
   [Person (= ?name1 name) (= ?age1 age)]
   [Person (= ?name2 name) (= ?age2 age)]
   [:test (> ?age1 ?age2)]
   =>
   (println (str ?name1 "is older than" ?name2)))

;; query
(defquery get-promotions
  "Query to find promotions for the purchase."
  [?type]
  [?promotion <- Promotion (= ?type type)])

   These different implementations make it possible to incorporate
   principles of logic programming into more global projects based on
   versatile and commonly used programming languages.

A Real-Life scenario

   Let's now address the question of using logic programming concepts in a
   concrete use-case.

   In a previous article I discussed the fact I developed a software whose
   main purpose is to transform complex data. The Clojure language allowed
   me to respond to the overall complexity of the solution.

   However, as the complexity of the software increased, I increasingly
   felt the need to represent all the rules for managing transformations
   (several hundred to date) as well as business rules for data
   validation, with a desire to express these in an understandable and
   maintainable format.

   Until then I used transformation functions that include if-conditionals
   to apply changes only on certains conditions such as matching ids ; as
   follows:
(defn assemble [a b]
  (if (and (= (:id a) (:id b)) (:weight b) (:weight a))  ;; predicates
    (update a :weight + (:weight b))                     ;; transformation
    a))                                                  ;; else

(assemble {:id 123 :weight 100} {:id 123 :weight 25})   ;; => {:id 123, :weight
125}
(assemble {:id 123 :weight 100} {:id 456 :weight 25})   ;; => {:id 123, :weight
100}

   The approach based on the Meander library allows to pass all the
   business logic in more a declarative form, for all the rules for
   pattern-matching and transformation.
(require '[meander.epsilon :as m])

(defn assemble [a b]
  (m/match
   {:a a :b b}                                         ;; facts

    {:a {:id ?id :weight ?weight-a}
     :b {:id ?id :weight ?weight-b}}                   ;; matching + predicate
    {:id ?id :weight (+ ?weight-a ?weight-b)}          ;; transformation

    _ a                                                ;; else
    ))

(assemble {:id 123 :weight 100} {:id 123 :weight 25})   ;; => {:id 123, :weight
125}
(assemble {:id 123 :weight 100} {:id 456 :weight 25})   ;; => {:id 123, :weight
100}

   In addition, the expressive approach of meander makes it possible to
   extract the definiton of the rule in the form of a data structure;
   which, once isolated from the rest of the code, represents a kind of
   predicate-as-data for declaring all the business logic of the solution.

   Let's go a step further and try see how to use a domain-specific
   language (DSL) to express rules for the same operations.
(require '[meander.epsilon :as m])

;; facts
(def part-a {:id 123 :weight 100})
(def part-b {:id 123 :weight 25})

;; rules
(defn transform [expression]
  (m/match expression
    [:assemble {:id ?id :weight ?weight-a} {:id ?id :weight ?weight-b}]
    {:id ?id :weight (+ ?weight-a ?weight-b)}

    [:substract {:id ?id :weight ?weight-a} {:id ?id :weight ?weight-b}]
    {:id ?id :weight (- ?weight-a ?weight-b)}

    [:heaviest {:id ?id :weight ?weight-a} {:id ?id :weight ?weight-b}]
    {:id ?id :weight (max ?weight-a ?weight-b)}
    _
    expression))

;; queries
(transform [:assemble part-a part-b])  ;; => {:id 123, :weight 125}
(transform [:substract part-a part-b]) ;; => {:id 123, :weight 75}
(transform [:heaviest part-a part-b])  ;; => {:id 123, :weight: 100}
(transform [:undef part-a part-b])     ;; => [:undef {:id 123, :weight 100} {:id
 123, :weight 25}]

   In summary, today I take advantage of the joint use of the native
   functionalities of Clojure and some features taken from the logical
   programming paradigm ; The best of both worlds.

Caveats & Conclusion

   While logic programming offers a unique and powerful approach to
   problem-solving, it is not without its limitations and challenges. Here
   are some of the caveats of logic programming that should be considered
   when evaluating its suitability for a specific project:
     * Computational Efficiency: Logic programming can be computationally
       expensive, especially for complex problems with large knowledge
       bases. The search for solutions through logical inference can
       become time-consuming, particularly in cases where multiple
       solutions exist or when dealing with extensive data sets.
     * Non-determinism: Logic programming is an inherently
       non-deterministic programming paradigm, meaning that the system is
       designed to find all possible solutions rather than a single
       deterministic result. This non-determinism can be difficult to
       control and may lead to unpredictable behavior, especially in
       large-scale applications.
     * Debugging Complexity: Debugging logic programs can be challenging
       due to their declarative nature and the non-deterministic execution
       flow. Identifying the source of errors or unexpected results can be
       time-consuming and may require a deep understanding of the
       underlying logic and search strategies.

   Despite these caveats, logic programming remains a valuable tool for a
   variety of applications, particularly those that require knowledge
   representation.

   Careful consideration of these limitations and understanding the
   strengths of logic programming are crucial for making informed
   decisions about its suitability for specific projects.

   Logic programming is not a silver bullet. But it offers a range of very
   interesting possibilities if used sparingly.

   To date, the timely use of functionalities taken from logic programming
   has made it possible to considerably improve the maintainability of my
   code in production.

   I will therefore continue to rely on this approach for future
   developments.
