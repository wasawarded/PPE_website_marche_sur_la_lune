   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Intentional delayed sabotage of a computer program with activation
   subject to conditions

   A logic bomb is a piece of code intentionally inserted into a software
   system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions
   are met. For example, a programmer may hide a piece of code that starts
   deleting files (such as a salary database trigger), should they ever be
   terminated from the company.

   Software that is inherently malicious, such as viruses and worms, often
   contain logic bombs that execute a certain payload at a pre-defined
   time or when some other condition is met. This technique can be used by
   a virus or worm to gain momentum and spread before being noticed. Some
   viruses attack their host systems on specific dates, such as Friday the
   13th or April Fools' Day. Trojans and other computer viruses that
   activate on certain dates are often called "time bombs".

   To be considered a logic bomb, the payload should be unwanted and
   unknown to the user of the software. As an example, trial programs with
   code that disables certain functionality after a set time are not
   normally regarded as logic bombs.

   [edit]
     * In June 2006 Roger Duronio, a system administrator for UBS, was
       charged with using a logic bomb to damage the company's computer
       network, and with securities fraud for his failed plan to drive
       down the company's stock with activation of the logic bomb.^[1]^[2]
       Duronio was later convicted and sentenced to 8 years and 1 month in
       prison, as well as a $3.1 million restitution to UBS.^[3]
     * On 20 March 2013, in an attack launched against South Korea, a
       logic bomb struck machines and "wiped the hard drives and master
       boot records of at least three banks and two media companies
       simultaneously."^[4]^[5] Symantec reported that the malware also
       contained a component that was capable of wiping Linux
       machines.^[6]^[7]
     * On 19 July 2019, David Tinley, a contract employee, pleaded guilty
       for programming logic bombs within the software he created for
       Siemens Corporation.^[8] The software was intentionally made to
       malfunction after a certain amount of time, requiring the company
       to hire him to fix it for a fee. The logic bombs went undetected
       for two years, but were then discovered while he was out of town
       and had to hand over the administrative password to his
       software.^[9]
     * In 2023, researchers discovered that some Newag trains were
       secretly programmed to deliberately break down after a certain
       distance, or during maintenance windows, or when onboard GPS
       confirmed they were located in rivals' workshops for
       repair.^[10]^[11]

Attempted

   [edit]
     * In February 2000, Tony Xiaotong Yu, indicted before a grand jury,
       was accused of planting a logic bomb during his employment as a
       programmer and securities trader at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. The
       bomb, planted in 1996, had a trigger date of 20 July 2000, but was
       discovered by other programmers in the company. Removing and
       cleaning up after the bomb allegedly took several months.^[12]
     * On 2 October 2003 Yung-Hsun Lin, also known as Andy Lin, changed
       code on a server at Medco Health Solutions Inc.'s Fair Lawn, New
       Jersey headquarters, where he was employed as a Unix administrator,
       creating a logic bomb set to go off on his birthday in 2004. It
       failed to work due to a programming error, so Lin corrected the
       error and reset it to go off on his next birthday, but it was
       discovered and disabled by a Medco computer systems administrator a
       few months before the trigger date. Lin pleaded guilty and was
       sentenced to 30 months in jail in a federal prison in addition to
       $81,200 in restitution. The charges held a maximum sentence of 10
       years and a fine of US$250,000.^[13]^[14]
     * On 29 October 2008 a logic bomb was discovered at American mortgage
       giant Fannie Mae. The bomb was planted by Rajendrasinh Babubhai
       Makwana, an IT contractor who worked at Fannie Mae's Urbana,
       Maryland facility. The bomb was set to activate on 31 January 2009
       and could have wiped all of Fannie Mae's 4000 servers. Makwana had
       been terminated around 1:00 p.m. on 24 October 2008 and managed to
       plant the bomb before his network access was revoked. Makwana was
       indicted in a Maryland court on 27 January 2009 for unauthorized
       computer access,^[15]^[16] convicted on 4 October 2010, and
       sentenced to 41 months in prison on 17 December 2010.^[17]
     * In October 2009, Douglas Duchak was terminated from his job as data
       analyst at the Colorado Springs Operations Center (CSOC) of the
       U.S. Transportation Security Administration. Surveillance cameras
       captured images of Duchak entering the facility after hours and
       loading a logic bomb onto a CSOC server that stored data from the
       U.S. Marshals. In January 2011, Duchak was sentenced to two years
       in prison, $60,587 in fines, and three years on probation.^[18] At
       his sentencing, Duchak tearfully apologized as his lawyer noted
       that at the time of the incident, Duchak's wife was pregnant with
       their second child. The judge at the sentencing mentioned that this
       logic bomb planting "incident was an anomaly in an otherwise
       untarnished work history."^[19]

Alleged

   [edit]

   Thomas C. Reed wrote in his 2004 book At the Abyss: An Insider's
   History of the Cold War that in 1982, a sabotage occurred on the
   Trans-Siberian Pipeline because of a logic bomb. According to Reed, a
   KGB operative stole the plans for a sophisticated control system and
   its software from a Canadian firm, for use on its Siberian pipeline.
   The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was tipped off by documents in
   the Farewell Dossier, and had the company insert a logic bomb in the
   program for sabotage purposes.^[20]^[21] Critics have contested the
   authenticity of this account,^[22]^[23] and it was reported that the
   story may be a hoax.^[24]
