   In artificial intelligence, with implications for cognitive science,
   the frame problem describes an issue with using first-order logic to
   express facts about a robot in the world. Representing the state of a
   robot with traditional first-order logic requires the use of many
   axioms that simply imply that things in the environment do not change
   arbitrarily. For example, Hayes describes a "block world" with rules
   about stacking blocks together. In a first-order logic system,
   additional axioms are required to make inferences about the environment

   connection with the problem of limiting the beliefs that have to be
   updated in response to actions. In the logical context, actions are
   typically specified by what they change, with the implicit assumption

   off at time 0, and the door opened at time 1, can be directly
   represented in logic ^[clarification needed] by the following formulae:

   While the three formulae above are a direct expression in logic of what
   is known, they do not suffice to correctly draw consequences. While the

   domain can be first expressed in this language and then automatically
   translated into logic. In this article, only the expression in logic is
   shown, and only in the simplified language with no action names.

   A successor state axiom is a formalization in logic of these two facts.
   For example, if

   The fluent calculus is a variant of the situation calculus. It solves
   the frame problem by using first-order logic terms, rather than
   predicates, to represent the states. Converting predicates into terms
   in first-order logic is called reification; the fluent calculus can be
   seen as a logic in which predicates representing the state of
   conditions are reified.

   The difference between a predicate and a term in first-order logic is
   that a term is a representation of an object (possibly a complex object
--
   The event calculus solves the frame problem, eliminating undesired
   solutions, by using a non-monotonic logic, such as first-order logic
   with circumscription^[3] or by treating the event calculus as a logic
   program using negation as failure.

Default logic solution

   Encyclopædia", c. 1679). This default, sometimes called the commonsense
   law of inertia, was expressed by Raymond Reiter in default logic:

   The counterpart of the default logic solution in the language of answer
   set programming is a rule with strong negation:

Separation logic solution

--

   Separation logic is a formalism for reasoning about computer programs
   using pre/post specifications of the form
--
   {\displaystyle \{\mathrm {precondition} \}\ \mathrm {code} \ \{\mathrm
   {postcondition} \}} . Separation logic is an extension of Hoare logic
   oriented to reasoning about mutable data structures in computer memory
--

   Separation logic employs a tight interpretation of pre/post specs,
   which say that the code can only access memory locations guaranteed to
   exist by the precondition.^[7] This leads to the soundness of the most
   important inference rule of the logic, the frame rule

--

   There appears to be some similarity between the separation logic
   solution to the frame problem and that of the fluent calculus mentioned
--
   Since domains are expressed in these languages rather than directly in
   logic, the frame problem only arises when a specification given in an
   action description logic is to be translated into logic. Typically,
   however, a translation is given from these languages to answer set
   programming rather than first-order logic.
