     * Two Level Implementation of Logic Gates
       The term "two-level logic" refers to a logic design that uses no
       more than two logic gates between input and output. This does not
       mean that the entire design will only have two logic gates, but it
       does mean that the single path from input to output will only have
       two logic gates. In two-level logic
