   Operators corresponding to logical disjunction exist in most
   programming languages.

   Many languages distinguish between bitwise and logical disjunction by
   providing two distinct operators; in languages following C, bitwise
   disjunction is performed with the single pipe operator (|), and logical
   disjunction with the double pipe (||) operator.

   (left) operand evaluates to true, then the second (right) operand is
   not evaluated. The logical disjunction operator thus usually
   constitutes a sequence point.

   Although the type of a logical disjunction expression is Boolean in
   most languages (and thus can only have the value true or false), in
   some languages (such as Python and JavaScript), the logical disjunction
   operator returns one of its operands: the first operand if it evaluates

   The membership of an element of a union set in set theory is defined in

   {\displaystyle x\in A\cup B\Leftrightarrow (x\in A)\vee (x\in B)} .
   Because of this, logical disjunction satisfies many of the same
   identities as set-theoretic union, such as associativity,
   commutativity, distributivity, and de Morgan's laws, identifying
   logical conjunction with set intersection, logical negation with set
   complement.^[11]
