   in-memory data structures holding the address is typically 32 or 64
   bits. Most hard disk drives released after 1996 implement logical block
   addressing.

   In logical block addressing, only one number is used to address data,
   and each linear base address describes a single block.

   In redundant array of independent disks (RAID) devices and storage area
   networks (SANs) and where logical drives (logical unit numbers, LUNs)
   are composed via LUN virtualization and aggregation, LBA addressing of
