   collaborators in early 1970s, based on the theoretical foundation of
   logic of computable functions previously proposed by Dana Scott. Work
   on the LCF system introduced the general-purpose programming language
--
   Among subsequent implementations is Cambridge LCF. Later systems
   simplified the logic to use total instead of partial functions, leading
   to HOL, HOL Light, and the Isabelle proof assistant that supports
   various logics. As of 2019, the Isabelle proof assistant still contains
   an implementation of an LCF logic, Isabelle/LCF.
