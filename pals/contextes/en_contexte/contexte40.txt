     It begins with an elementary but thorough overview of mathematical
     logic of first order. The treatment extends beyond a single method
     of formulating logic to offer instruction in a variety of
     techniques: model theory (truth tables), Hilbert-type proof theory,

     the newer ideas and the more profound results of twentieth-century
     logical research. Subsequent chapters explore the study of formal
     number theory, with surveys of the famous incompleteness and
     undecidability results of Godel, Church, Turing, and others. The
     emphasis in the final chapter reverts to logic, with examinations of
     Godel's completeness theorem, Gentzen's theorem, Skolem's paradox

       $\begingroup$ I strongly recommend to cover at least some basics of
       Mathematical Logic. The literature is full with logical flawed
       articles. Hence, you should master a level to be able to recognize

   page and few pages here and there). That is about 900 pages out of
   about 1000 page book that rely heavily on formal mathematical logic.

   mathematical proofs can vary but in most of them I cant think of any
   graduate text that would not lean heavily on formal mathematical logic.
   Maybe philosophy of economics or history of economic thought would be

   Contemporary Introduction by Julian Reiss includes some parts that are
   written in formal mathematical logic)

   will be able to understand and even construct proofs without ever
   sitting in any course on formal mathematical logic. Any study of
   mathematics implicitly also teaches you formal mathematical logic -
   just not in necessary structured or obvious way.

     * Almost every Hermitian matrix has distinct eigenvalue differences
     * If models of first-order logic are defined using set theory, is
       every first-order theory implicitly an extension of set theory?
