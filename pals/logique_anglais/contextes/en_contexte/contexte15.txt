     This entry is an introduction to science maps and science mapping.
     It focuses on the conceptual, theoretical, and methodological issues
     of science mapping, rather than on the mathematical formulation of

     We also discuss some epistemological and sociological topics that
     can help in the interpretation, contextualization, and assessment of

   of science mapping to the humanities. In Section 7, some
   epistemological topics, which bridge across science mapping, sociology
   of science, and philosophy of science are discussed: the objectivity of

   patents allows tracing the links between scientific knowledge and

   scientists that are both authors of scientific publications and
   inventors of patents, it is possible to map the overlap between
   scientific and technological literature (Murray 2002). In the last
   years, text-mining techniques (see Section 4.2.2: Co-word analysis

   In this section, we deal with some epistemological and sociological
   topics related to science mapping. We start by asking in what sense
--
   In the previous sections, we saw how the creation of a science map
   involves several methodological and technical decisions from the
   science cartographer, such as the unit of analysis, the mapping

   “objective”. Rather, they result from a combination of the features of
   the mapped field, on the one hand, and the methodological decisions of
   the science cartographer on the other hand. However, we should

   allow reconstructing the terminology of a scientific field because they
   reflect thousands of terminological micro-choices made by the
   researchers when drafting the titles and abstracts of their papers. The
   relations between the different terms are the results of these choices.
   Idiosyncratic and non-standard terminological would again choices
   cancel out when enough publications are considered.

   The socio-constructivist approach to citations is grounded in the
   socio-constructivist sociology of science, a sociological paradigm that
   raised in different forms in the 1970s partly as a reaction to the
