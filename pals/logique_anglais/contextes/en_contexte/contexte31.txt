   Logical consequence (also entailment or implication) is a fundamental
   concept in logic which describes the relationship between statements
   that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more
   statements. A valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is
   entailed by the premises, because the conclusion is the consequence of
   the premises. The philosophical analysis of logical consequence
   involves the questions: In what sense does a conclusion follow from its
   premises? and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of
   premises?^[1] All of philosophical logic is meant to provide accounts
   of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of logical
   truth.^[2]

   explain with formal proof and models of interpretation.^[1] A sentence
   is said to be a logical consequence of a set of sentences, for a given
   language, if and only if, using only logic (i.e., without regard to any
   personal interpretations of the sentences) the sentence must be true if

   {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}} . The Polish logician Alfred Tarski
   identified three features of an adequate characterization of
   entailment: (1) The logical consequence relation relies on the logical
   form of the sentences: (2) The relation is a priori, i.e., it can be
   determined with or without regard to empirical evidence (sense
   experience); and (3) The logical consequence relation has a modal
   component.^[3]

   The most widely prevailing view on how best to account for logical
   consequence is to appeal to formality. This is to say that whether
   statements follow from one another logically depends on the structure
   or logical form of the statements without regard to the contents of
   that form.

   Syntactic accounts of logical consequence rely on schemes using
   inference rules. For instance, we can express the logical form of a
   valid argument as:

   experience, so they must be knowable a priori.^[1] However, formality
   alone does not guarantee that logical consequence is not influenced by
   empirical knowledge. So the a priori property of logical consequence is
   considered to be independent of formality.^[1]
--

   The two prevailing techniques for providing accounts of logical
   consequence involve expressing the concept in terms of proofs and via
   models. The study of the syntactic consequence (of a logic) is called
   (its) proof theory whereas the study of (its) semantic consequence is

   Modal accounts of logical consequence are variations on the following
   basic idea:
--
   Such accounts are called "modal" because they appeal to the modal
   notions of logical necessity and logical possibility. 'It is necessary
   that' is often expressed as a universal quantifier over possible

   The conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises because we can

   Modal-formal accounts of logical consequence combine the modal and
   formal accounts above, yielding variations on the following basic idea:

          {\displaystyle A} if and only if it is impossible for an
          argument with the same logical form as
