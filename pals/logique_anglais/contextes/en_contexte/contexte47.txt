   In this chapter, we will focus logic programming and how it helps in
   Artificial Intelligence.

   We already know that logic is the study of principles of correct
   reasoning or in simple words it is the study of what comes after what.

   Logic Programming is the combination of two words, logic and
   programming. Logic Programming is a programming paradigm in which the
   problems are expressed as facts and rules by program statements but
   within a system of formal logic. Just like other programming paradigms
   like object oriented, functional, declarative, and procedural, etc., it
--
   why they are called the building blocks of Logic Programming. A goal
   needs to be specified for every program in logic programming. To
   understand how a problem can be solved in logic programming, we need to
   know about the building blocks − Facts and Rules −
--

   Actually, every logic program needs facts to work with so that it can
   achieve the given goal. Facts basically are true statements about the
--
   Actually, rules are the constraints which allow us to make conclusions
   about the problem domain. Rules basically written as logical clauses to
   express various facts. For example, if we are building any game then
--
   Rules are very important to solve any problem in Logic Programming.
   Rules are basically logical conclusion which can express the facts.
   Following is the syntax of rule −

   For starting logic programming in Python, we need to install the
   following two packages −
--
   It provides us a way to simplify the way we made code for business
   logic. It lets us express the logic in terms of rules and facts. The
   following command will help you install kanren −
--

   Followings are some examples which can be solved by logic programming −

--

   Actually we can find the unknown values by using logic programming in a
   very effective way. The following Python code will help you match a
--

   With the help of logic programming, we can find the prime numbers from
   a list of numbers and can also generate prime numbers. The Python code
