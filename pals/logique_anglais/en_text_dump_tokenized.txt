Related
Work
Relying
on
the
trace
of
a
complete
DPLL
based
solver
is
the
prevailing
technique
for
CNF
d-DNNF
compilers
used
by
both
DSHARP
and
C
2
D
2
The
DPLL
trace
has
been
leveraged
for
proving
bounds
on
model
counting
such
as
the
work
of
Beame
et
al
3
It
has
also
been
used
to
good
effect
for
proving
theoretical
results
about
the
worst-case
size
complexity
of
the
d-DNNF
representation
4
Knowledge
compilers
including
the
DSHARP
software
presented
in
this
paper
have
played
a
role
as
subcomponents
in
larger
systems
One
example
is
in
the
SAT-based
analysis
of
quantification
information
flow
programs
where
efficient
methods
for
conditioned
model
counting
using
d-DNNF
were
exploited
5
Another
example
is
the
Probabilistic
Logic
Programming
framework
ProbLog
6
Here
the
model
counters
were
used
to
provide
probabilistic
inference
for
targeted
queries
compiled
from
a
given
logic
program
Finally
since
the
original
publication
of
this
work
in
2012
by
Muise
et
al
the
DSHARP
software
has
been
extended
in
a
variety
of
ways
Most
notably
the
software
has
been
extended
to
do
model
counting
with
the
assumption
of
stable
model
semantics
7
as
well
as
extended
to
do
projected
model
counting
and
projected
knowledge
compilation
8
For
stable
model
counting
every
model
represented
by
the
compiled
theory
must
be
stable
a
notion
in
logic
programming
that
stipulates
that
the
truth
of
atoms
cannot
be
self
supporting
given
the
logic
program’s
rules
9
To
accommodate
for
stable
models
DSHARP
was
modified
to
include
an
internal
propagator
that
rules
out
any
model
deemed
not
stable
Subsequently
clauses
are
learned
to
rule
out
the
unstable
models
and
the
final
compiled
d-DNNF
theory
represents
all
stable
models
The
problem
of
projected
model
counting
respectively
projected
knowledge
compilation
is
to
count
the
number
of
models
resp
produce
the
d-DNNF
for
the
Boolean
theory
after
projecting
away
a
subset
of
the
variables
Intuitively
a
model
for
the
projected
theory
exists
if
the
same
setting
of
variables
corresponds
to
at
least
one
model
of
the
full
theory
DSHARP
was
modified
in
a
variety
of
ways
to
achieve
projected
model
counting
and
knowledge
compilation
These
included
1
dedicated
variable
ordering
heuristics
to
focus
on
the
projected
variables
2
advanced
back-tracking
to
avoid
recomputing
the
same
projected
model
and
3
a
re-determinization
method
to
convert
a
DNNF
theory
back
into
d-DNNF

Depiction
of
inference
using

Logic
studies
valid
forms
of
inference
like
modus
ponens
Logic
is
the
study
of
correct
reasoning
It
includes
both
formal
and
informal
logic
Formal
logic
is
the
study
of
deductively
valid
inferences
or
logical
truths
It
examines
how
conclusions
follow
from
premises
based
on
the
structure
of
arguments
alone
independent
of
their
topic
and
content
Informal
logic
is
associated
with
informal
fallacies
critical
thinking
and
argumentation
theory
Informal
logic
examines
arguments
expressed
in
natural
language
whereas
formal
logic
uses
formal
language
When
used
as
a
countable
noun
the
term
a
logic
refers
to
a
specific
logical
formal
system
that
articulates
a
proof
system
Logic
plays
a
central
role
in
many
fields
such
as
philosophy
mathematics
computer
science
and
linguistics
Logic
studies
arguments
which
consist
of
a
set
of
premises
that
leads
to
a
conclusion
An
example
is
the
argument
from
the
premises
it's
Sunday
and
if
it's
Sunday
then
I
don't
have
to
work
leading
to
the
conclusion
I
don't
have
to
work
1
Premises
and
conclusions
express
propositions
or
claims
that
can
be
true
or
false
An
important
feature
of
propositions
is
their
internal
structure
For
example
complex
propositions
are
made
up
of

Simple

Sunday

in
the

The
truth
of
a
proposition
usually
depends
on
the
meanings
of
all
of
its
parts
However
this
is
not
the
case
for
logically
true
propositions
They
are
true
only
because
of
their
logical
structure
independent
of
the
specific
meanings
of
the
individual
parts
Arguments
can
be
either
correct
or
incorrect
An
argument
is
correct
if
its
premises
support
its
conclusion
Deductive
arguments
have
the
strongest
form
of
support
if
their
premises
are
true
then
their
conclusion
must
also
be
true
This
is
not
the
case
for
ampliative
arguments
which
arrive
at
genuinely
new
information
not
found
in
the
premises
Many
arguments
in
everyday
discourse
and
the
sciences
are
ampliative
arguments
They
are
divided
into
inductive
and
abductive
arguments
Inductive
arguments
are
statistical
generalizations
such
as
inferring
that
all
ravens
are
black
based
on
many
individual
observations
of
black
ravens
2
Abductive
arguments
are
inferences
to
the
best
explanation
for
example
when
a
doctor
concludes
that
a
patient
has
a
certain
disease
which
explains
the
symptoms
they
suffer
3
Arguments
that
fall
short
of
the
standards

embody
fallacies
Systems
of
logic
are
theoretical
frameworks
for
assessing
the
correctness
of
arguments
Logic
has
been
studied
since
antiquity
Early
approaches
include
Aristotelian
logic
Stoic
logic
Nyaya
and
Mohism
Aristotelian
logic
focuses
on
reasoning
in
the
form
of
syllogisms
It
was
considered
the
main
system
of
logic
in
the
Western
world
until
it
was
replaced
by
modern
formal
logic
which
has
its
roots
in
the
work
of
late
19
th-century
mathematicians
such
as
Gottlob
Frege
Today
the
most
commonly
used
system
is
classical
logic
It
consists
of
propositional
logic
and
first-order
logic
Propositional
logic
only
considers
logical
relations
between
full
propositions
First-order
logic
also
takes
the
internal
parts
of
propositions
into
account
like
predicates
and
quantifiers
Extended
logics
accept
the
basic
intuitions
behind
classical
logic
and
apply
it
to
other
fields
such
as
metaphysics
ethics
and
epistemology
Deviant
logics
on
the
other
hand
reject
certain
classical
intuitions
and
provide
alternative
explanations
of
the
basic
laws
of
logic
Definition
edit
The
word
logic
originates
from
the
Greek
word
logos
which
has
a
variety
of
translations
such
as
reason
discourse
or
language
4
Logic
is
traditionally
defined
as
the
study
of
the
laws
of
thought
or
correct
reasoning
5
and
is
usually
understood
in
terms
of
inferences
or
arguments
Reasoning
is
the
activity
of
drawing
inferences
Arguments
are
the
outward
expression
of
inferences
6
An
argument
is
a
set
of
premises
together
with
a
conclusion
Logic
is
interested
in
whether
arguments
are
correct
i.e
whether
their
premises
support
the
conclusion
7
These
general
characterizations
apply
to
logic
in
the
widest
sense
i.e
to
both
formal
and
informal
logic
since
they
are
both
concerned
with
assessing
the
correctness
of
arguments
8
Formal
logic
is
the
traditionally
dominant
field
and
some
logicians
restrict
logic
to
formal
logic
9
Formal
logic
edit
Further
information
Formal
system
Formal
logic
is
also
known
as
symbolic
logic
and
is
widely
used
in
mathematical
logic
It
uses
a
formal
approach
to
study
reasoning
it
replaces
concrete
expressions
with
abstract
symbols
to
examine
the
logical
form
of
arguments
independent
of
their
concrete
content
In
this
sense
it
is
topic-neutral
since
it
is
only
concerned
with
the
abstract
structure
of
arguments
and
not
with
their
concrete
content
10
Formal
logic
is
interested
in
deductively
valid
arguments
for
which
the
truth
of
their
premises
ensures
the
truth
of
their
conclusion
This
means
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
premises
to
be
true
and
the
conclusion
to
be
false
11
For
valid
arguments
the
logical
structure
of
the
premises
and
the
conclusion
follows
a
pattern
called
a
rule
of
inference
12
For
example
modus
ponens
is
a
rule
of
inference
according
to
which
all
arguments
of
the
form
1
p
2
if
p
then
q
3
therefore
q
are
valid
independent
of
what
the
terms
p
and
q
stand
for
13
In
this
sense
formal
logic
can
be
defined
as
the
science
of
valid
inferences
An
alternative
definition
sees
logic
as
the
study
of
logical
truths
14
A
proposition
is
logically
true
if
its
truth
depends
only
on
the
logical
vocabulary
used
in
it
This
means
that
it
is
true
in
all
possible
worlds
and
under
all
interpretations
of
its
non-logical
terms
like
the
claim
either
it
is
raining
or
it
is
not
15
These
two
definitions
of
formal
logic
are
not
identical
but
they
are
closely
related
For
example
if
the
inference
from
p
to
q
is
deductively
valid
then
the
claim
if
p
then
q
is
a
logical
truth
16
Visualization
of
how
to
translate
an
English
sentence
into
first-order
logic
Formal
logic
needs
to
translate
natural
language
arguments
into
a
formal
language
like
first-order
logic
to
assess
whether
they
are
valid
In
this
example
the
letter
c
represents
Carmen
while
the
letters
M
and
T
stand
for
Mexican
and
teacher
The
symbol
has
the
meaning
of
and
Formal
logic
uses
formal
languages
to
express
and
analyze
arguments
17
They
normally
have
a
very
limited
vocabulary
and
exact
syntactic
rules
These
rules
specify
how
their
symbols
can
be
combined
to
construct
sentences
so-called
well-formed
formulas
18
This
simplicity
and
exactness
of
formal
logic
make
it
capable
of
formulating
precise
rules
of
inference
They
determine
whether
a
given
argument
is
valid
19
Because
of
the
reliance
on
formal
language
natural
language
arguments
cannot
be
studied
directly
Instead
they
need
to
be
translated
into
formal
language
before
their
validity
can
be
assessed
20
The
term
logic
can
also
be
used
in
a
slightly
different
sense
as
a
countable
noun
In
this
sense
a
logic
is
a
logical
formal
system
Distinct
logics
differ
from
each
other
concerning
the
rules
of
inference
they
accept
as
valid
and
the
formal
languages
used
to
express
them
21
Starting
in
the
late
19
th
century
many
new
formal
systems
have
been
proposed
There
are
disagreements
about
what
makes
a
formal
system
a
logic
22
For
example
it
has
been
suggested
that
only
logically
complete
systems
like
first-order
logic
qualify
as
logics
For
such
reasons
some
theorists
deny
that
higher-order
logics
are
logics
in
the
strict
sense
23
Informal
logic
edit
Main
article
Informal
logic
When
understood
in
a
wide
sense
logic
encompasses
both
formal
and
informal
logic
24
Informal
logic
uses
non-formal
criteria
and
standards
to
analyze
and
assess
the
correctness
of
arguments
Its
main
focus
is
on
everyday
discourse
25
Its
development
was
prompted
by
difficulties
in
applying
the
insights
of
formal
logic
to
natural
language
arguments
26
In
this
regard
it
considers
problems
that
formal
logic
on
its
own
is
unable
to
address
27
Both
provide
criteria
for
assessing
the
correctness
of
arguments
and
distinguishing
them
from
fallacies
28
Many
characterizations
of
informal
logic
have
been
suggested
but
there
is
no
general
agreement
on
its
precise
definition
29
The
most
literal
approach
sees
the
terms
formal
and
informal
as
applying
to
the
language
used
to
express
arguments
On
this
view
informal
logic
studies
arguments
that
are
in
informal
or
natural
language
30
Formal
logic
can
only
examine
them
indirectly
by
translating
them
first
into
a
formal
language
while
informal
logic
investigates
them
in
their
original
form
31
On
this
view
the
argument
Birds
fly
Tweety
is
a
bird
Therefore
Tweety
flies
belongs
to
natural
language
and
is
examined
by
informal
logic
But

formal
translation

Flies(Tweety
is
studied
by
formal
logic
32
The
study
of
natural
language
arguments
comes
with
various
difficulties
For
example
natural
language
expressions
are
often
ambiguous
vague
and
context-dependent
33
Another
approach
defines
informal
logic
in
a
wide
sense
as
the
normative
study
of
the
standards
criteria
and
procedures
of
argumentation
In
this
sense
it
includes
questions
about
the
role
of
rationality
critical
thinking
and
the
psychology
of
argumentation
34
Another
characterization
identifies
informal
logic
with
the
study
of
non-deductive
arguments
In
this
way
it
contrasts
with
deductive
reasoning
examined
by
formal
logic
35
Non-deductive
arguments
make
their
conclusion
probable
but
do
not
ensure
that
it
is
true
An
example
is
the
inductive
argument
from
the
empirical
observation
that
all
ravens
I
have
seen
so
far
are
black
to
the
conclusion
all
ravens
are
black
36
A
further
approach
is
to
define
informal
logic
as
the
study
of
informal
fallacies
37
Informal
fallacies
are
incorrect
arguments
in
which
errors
are
present
in
the
content
and
the
context
of
the
argument
38
A
false
dilemma
for
example
involves
an
error
of
content
by
excluding
viable
options
This
is
the
case
in
the
fallacy
you
are
either
with
us
or
against
us
you
are
not
with
us
therefore
you
are
against
us
39
Some
theorists
state
that
formal
logic
studies
the
general
form
of
arguments
while
informal
logic
studies
particular
instances
of
arguments
Another
approach
is
to
hold
that
formal
logic
only
considers
the
role
of
logical
constants
for
correct
inferences
while
informal
logic
also
takes
the
meaning
of
substantive
concepts
into
account
Further
approaches
focus
on
the
discussion
of
logical
topics
with
or
without
formal
devices
and
on
the
role
of
epistemology
for
the
assessment
of
arguments

Main
articles
Premise
and
Logical
consequence
Premises
and
conclusions
are
the
basic
parts
of
inferences
or
arguments
and
therefore
play
a
central
role
in
logic
In
the
case
of
a
valid
inference
or
a
correct
argument
the
conclusion
follows
from
the
premises
or
in
other
words
the
premises
support
the
conclusion
41
For
instance
the
premises
Mars
is
red
and
Mars
is
a
planet
support
the
conclusion
Mars
is
a
red
planet
For
most
types
of
logic
it
is
accepted
that
premises
and
conclusions
have
to
be
truth-bearers
41
a
This
means
that
they
have
a
truth
value
they
are
either
true
or
false
Contemporary
philosophy
generally
sees
them
either
as
propositions
or
as
sentences
43
Propositions
are
the
denotations
of
sentences
and
are
usually
seen
as
abstract
objects
44
For
example
the
English
sentence
the
tree
is
green
is
different
from
the
German
sentence
der
Baum
ist
grün
but
both
express
the
same
proposition
45
Propositional
theories
of
premises
and
conclusions
are
often
criticized
because
they
rely
on
abstract
objects
For
instance
philosophical
naturalists
usually
reject
the
existence
of
abstract
objects
Other
arguments
concern
the
challenges
involved
in
specifying
the
identity
criteria
of
propositions
43
These
objections
are
avoided
by
seeing
premises
and
conclusions
not
as
propositions
but
as
sentences
i.e
as
concrete
linguistic
objects
like
the
symbols
displayed
on
a
page
of
a
book
But
this
approach
comes
with
new
problems
of
its
own
sentences
are
often
context-dependent
and
ambiguous
meaning
an
argument's
validity
would
not
only
depend
on
its
parts
but
also
on
its
context
and
on
how
it
is
interpreted
46
Another
approach
is
to
understand
premises
and
conclusions
in
psychological
terms
as
thoughts
or
judgments
This
position
is
known
as
psychologism
It
was
discussed
at
length
around
the
turn
of
the
20
th
century
but
it
is
not
widely
accepted
today
47
Internal
structure
edit
Premises
and
conclusions
have
an
internal
structure
As
propositions
or
sentences
they
can
be
either
simple
or
complex
48
A
complex
proposition
has
other
propositions
as
its
constituents
which
are
linked
to
each
other
through
propositional
connectives
like
and
or
if
then
Simple
propositions
on
the
other
hand
do
not
have
propositional
parts
But
they
can
also
be
conceived
as
having
an
internal
structure
they
are
made
up
of
subpropositional
parts
like
singular
terms
and
predicates
49
48
For
example
the
simple
proposition
Mars
is
red
can
be
formed
by
applying
the
predicate
red
to
the
singular
term
Mars
In
contrast
the
complex
proposition
Mars
is
red
and
Venus
is
white
is
made
up
of
two
simple
propositions
connected
by
the
propositional
connective
and
49
Whether
a
proposition
is
true
depends
at
least
in
part
on
its
constituents
For
complex
propositions
formed
using
truth-functional
propositional
connectives
their
truth
only
depends
on
the
truth
values
of
their
parts
49
50
But
this
relation
is
more
complicated
in
the
case
of
simple
propositions
and
their
subpropositional
parts
These
subpropositional
parts
have
meanings
of
their
own
like
referring
to
objects
or
classes
of
objects
51
Whether
the
simple
proposition
they
form
is
true
depends
on
their
relation
to
reality
i.e
what
the
objects
they
refer
to
are
like
This
topic
is
studied
by
theories
of
reference

Logical
truth
edit
Main
article
Logical
truth
Some
complex
propositions
are
true
independently
of
the
substantive
meanings
of
their
parts
53
In
classical
logic
for
example
the
complex
proposition
either
Mars
is
red
or
Mars
is
not
red
is
true
independent
of
whether
its
parts
like
the
simple
proposition
Mars
is
red
are
true
or
false
In
such
cases
the
truth
is
called
a
logical
truth
a
proposition
is
logically
true
if
its
truth
depends
only
on
the
logical
vocabulary
used
in
it
54
This
means
that
it
is
true
under
all
interpretations
of
its
non-logical
terms
In
some
modal
logics
this
means
that
the
proposition
is
true
in
all
possible
worlds
55
Some
theorists
define
logic
as
the
study
of
logical
truths

tables
can
be
used
to
show
how
logical
connectives
work
or
how
the
truth
values
of
complex
propositions
depends
on
their
parts
They
have
a
column
for
each
input
variable
Each
row
corresponds
to
one
possible
combination
of
the
truth
values
these
variables
can
take

truth
tables
presented

the
English

the

T

1

0
are
commonly
used
as

present
all
the

Arguments
and
inferences
edit
Main
articles
Argument
and
inference
Logic
is
commonly
defined
in
terms
of
arguments
or
inferences
as
the
study
of
their
correctness
59
An
argument
is
a
set
of
premises
together
with
a
conclusion
60
An
inference
is
the
process
of
reasoning
from
these
premises
to
the
conclusion
43
But
these
terms
are
often
used
interchangeably
in
logic
Arguments
are
correct
or
incorrect
depending
on
whether
their
premises
support
their
conclusion
Premises
and
conclusions
on
the
other
hand
are
true
or
false
depending
on
whether
they
are
in
accord
with
reality
In
formal
logic
a
sound
argument
is
an
argument
that
is
both
correct
and
has
only
true
premises
61
Sometimes
a
distinction
is
made
between
simple
and
complex
arguments
A
complex
argument
is
made
up
of
a
chain
of
simple
arguments
This
means
that
the
conclusion
of
one
argument
acts
as
a
premise
of
later
arguments
For
a
complex
argument
to
be
successful
each
link
of
the
chain
has
to
be
successful
43
Diagram
of
argument
terminology
used
in
logic
Argument
terminology
used
in
logic
Arguments
and
inferences
are
either
correct
or
incorrect
If
they
are
correct
then
their
premises
support
their
conclusion
In
the
incorrect
case
this
support
is
missing
It
can
take
different
forms
corresponding
to
the
different
types
of
reasoning
62
The
strongest
form
of
support
corresponds
to
deductive
reasoning
But
even
arguments
that
are
not
deductively
valid
may
still
be
good
arguments
because
their
premises
offer
non-deductive
support
to
their
conclusions
For
such
cases
the
term
ampliative
or
inductive
reasoning
is
used
63
Deductive
arguments
are
associated
with
formal
logic
in
contrast
to
the
relation
between
ampliative
arguments
and
informal
logic
64
Deductive
edit
A
deductively
valid
argument
is
one
whose
premises
guarantee
the
truth
of
its
conclusion
11
For
instance
the
argument
1
all
frogs
are
amphibians
2
no
cats
are
amphibians
3
therefore
no
cats
are
frogs
is
deductively
valid
For
deductive
validity
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
premises
or
the
conclusion
are
actually
true
So
the
argument
1
all
frogs
are
mammals
2
no
cats
are
mammals
3
therefore
no
cats
are
frogs
is
also
valid
because
the
conclusion
follows
necessarily
from
the
premises
65
According
to
an
influential
view
by
Alfred
Tarski
deductive
arguments
have
three
essential
features
1
they
are
formal
i.e
they
depend
only
on
the
form
of
the
premises
and
the
conclusion
2
they
are
a
priori
i.e
no
sense
experience
is
needed
to
determine
whether
they
obtain
3
they
are
modal
i.e
that
they
hold
by
logical
necessity
for
the
given
propositions
independent
of
any
other
circumstances
66
Because
of
the
first
feature
the
focus
on
formality
deductive
inference
is
usually
identified
with
rules
of
inference
67
Rules
of
inference
specify
the
form
of
the
premises
and
the
conclusion
how
they
have
to
be
structured
for
the
inference
to
be
valid
Arguments
that
do
not
follow
any
rule
of
inference
are
deductively
invalid
68
The
modus
ponens
is
a
prominent
rule
of
inference
It
has
the
form
p
if
p
then
q
therefore
q

The
third
feature
can
be
expressed
by
stating
that
deductively
valid
inferences
are
truth-preserving
it
is
impossible
for
the
premises
to
be
true
and
the
conclusion
to
be
false
71
Because
of
this
feature
it
is
often
asserted
that
deductive
inferences
are
uninformative
since
the
conclusion
cannot
arrive
at
new
information
not
already
present
in
the
premises
72
But
this
point
is
not
always
accepted
since
it
would
mean
for
example
that
most
of
mathematics
is
uninformative
A
different
characterization
distinguishes
between
surface
and
depth
information
The
surface
information
of
a
sentence
is
the
information
it
presents
explicitly
Depth
information
is
the
totality
of
the
information
contained
in
the
sentence
both
explicitly
and
implicitly
According
to
this
view
deductive
inferences
are
uninformative
on
the
depth
level
But
they
can
be
highly
informative
on
the
surface
level
by
making
implicit
information
explicit
This
happens
for
example
in
mathematical
proofs
73
Ampliative
edit
Ampliative
arguments
are
arguments
whose
conclusions
contain
additional
information
not
found
in
their
premises
In
this
regard
they
are
more
interesting
since
they
contain
information
on
the
depth
level
and
the
thinker
may
learn
something
genuinely
new
But
this
feature
comes
with
a
certain
cost
the
premises
support
the
conclusion
in
the
sense
that
they
make
its
truth
more
likely
but
they
do
not
ensure
its
truth
74
This
means
that
the
conclusion
of
an
ampliative
argument
may
be
false
even
though
all
its
premises
are
true
This
characteristic
is
closely
related
to
non-monotonicity
and
defeasibility
it
may
be
necessary
to
retract
an
earlier
conclusion
upon
receiving
new
information
or
in
light
of
new
inferences
drawn
75
Ampliative
reasoning
plays
a
central
role
in
many
arguments
found
in
everyday
discourse
and
the
sciences
Ampliative
arguments
are
not
automatically
incorrect
Instead
they
just
follow
different
standards
of
correctness
The
support
they
provide
for
their
conclusion
usually
comes
in
degrees
This
means
that
strong
ampliative
arguments
make
their
conclusion
very
likely
while
weak
ones
are
less
certain
As
a
consequence
the
line
between
correct
and
incorrect
arguments
is
blurry
in
some
cases
such
as
when
the
premises
offer
weak
but
non-negligible
support
This
contrasts
with
deductive
arguments
which
are
either
valid
or
invalid
with
nothing
in-between
76
The
terminology
used
to
categorize
ampliative
arguments
is
inconsistent
Some
authors
like
James
Hawthorne
use
the
term
induction
to
cover
all
forms
of
non-deductive
arguments
77
But
in
a
more
narrow
sense
induction
is
only
one
type
of
ampliative
argument
alongside
abductive
arguments
78
Some
philosophers
like
Leo
Groarke
also
allow
conductive
arguments
b
as
another
type
79
In
this
narrow
sense
induction
is
often
defined
as
a
form
of
statistical
generalization
80
In
this
case
the
premises
of
an
inductive
argument
are
many
individual
observations
that
all
show
a
certain
pattern
The
conclusion
then
is
a
general
law
that
this
pattern
always
obtains
81
In
this
sense
one
may
infer
that
all
elephants
are
gray
based
on
one's
past
observations
of
the
color
of
elephants
78
A
closely
related
form
of
inductive
inference
has
as
its
conclusion
not
a
general
law
but
one
more
specific
instance
as
when
it
is
inferred
that
an
elephant
one
has
not
seen
yet
is
also
gray
81
Some
theorists
like
Igor
Douven
stipulate
that
inductive
inferences
rest
only
on
statistical
considerations
This
way
they
can
be
distinguished
from
abductive
inference
78
Abductive
inference
may
or
may
not
take
statistical
observations
into
consideration
In
either
case
the
premises
offer
support
for
the
conclusion
because
the
conclusion
is
the
best
explanation
of
why
the
premises
are
true
82
In
this
sense
abduction
is
also
called
the
inference
to
the
best
explanation
83
For
example
given
the
premise
that
there
is
a
plate
with
breadcrumbs
in
the
kitchen
in
the
early
morning
one
may
infer
the
conclusion
that
one's
house-mate
had
a
midnight
snack
and
was
too
tired
to
clean
the
table
This
conclusion
is
justified
because
it
is
the
best
explanation
of
the
current
state
of
the
kitchen
78
For
abduction
it
is
not
sufficient
that
the
conclusion
explains
the
premises
For
example
the
conclusion
that
a
burglar
broke
into
the
house
last
night
got
hungry
on
the
job
and
had
a
midnight
snack
would
also
explain
the
state
of
the
kitchen
But
this
conclusion
is
not
justified
because
it
is
not
the
best
or
most
likely
explanation
82
83
Fallacies
edit
Not
all
arguments
live
up
to
the
standards
of
correct
reasoning
When
they
do
not
they
are
usually
referred
to
as
fallacies
Their
central
aspect
is
not
that
their
conclusion
is
false
but
that
there
is
some
flaw
with
the
reasoning
leading
to
this
conclusion
84
So
the
argument
it
is
sunny
today
therefore
spiders
have
eight
legs
is
fallacious
even
though
the
conclusion
is
true
Some
theorists
like
John
Stuart
Mill
give
a
more
restrictive
definition
of
fallacies
by
additionally
requiring
that
they
appear
to
be
correct
85
This
way
genuine
fallacies
can
be
distinguished
from
mere
mistakes
of
reasoning
due
to
carelessness
This
explains
why
people
tend
to
commit
fallacies
because
they
have
an
alluring
element
that
seduces
people
into
committing
and
accepting
them
86
However
this
reference
to
appearances
is
controversial
because
it
belongs
to
the
field
of
psychology
not
logic
and
because
appearances
may
be
different
for
different
people
87
Poster
from
1901
Young
America's
dilemma
Shall
I
be
wise
and
great
or
rich
and
powerful
poster
from
1901
This
is
an
example
of
a
false
dilemma
an
informal
fallacy
using
a
disjunctive
premise
that
excludes
viable
alternatives
Fallacies
are
usually
divided
into
formal
and
informal
fallacies
38
For
formal
fallacies
the
source
of
the
error
is
found
in
the
form
of
the
argument
For
example
denying
the
antecedent
is
one
type
of
formal
fallacy
as
in
if
Othello
is
a
bachelor
then
he
is
male
Othello
is
not
a
bachelor
therefore
Othello
is
not
male
88
But
most
fallacies
fall
into
the
category
of
informal
fallacies
of
which
a
great
variety
is
discussed
in
the
academic
literature
The
source
of
their
error
is
usually
found
in
the
content
or
the
context
of
the
argument
89
Informal
fallacies
are
sometimes
categorized
as
fallacies
of
ambiguity
fallacies
of
presumption
or
fallacies
of
relevance
For
fallacies
of
ambiguity
the
ambiguity
and
vagueness
of
natural
language
are
responsible
for
their
flaw
as
in
feathers
are
light
what
is
light
cannot
be
dark
therefore
feathers
cannot
be
dark
90
Fallacies
of
presumption
have
a
wrong
or
unjustified
premise
but
may
be
valid
otherwise
91
In
the
case
of
fallacies
of
relevance
the
premises
do
not
support
the
conclusion
because
they
are
not
relevant
to
it
92
Definitory
and
strategic
rules
edit
The
main
focus
of
most
logicians
is
to
study
the
criteria
according
to
which
an
argument
is
correct
or
incorrect
A
fallacy
is
committed
if
these
criteria
are
violated
In
the
case
of
formal
logic
they
are
known
as
rules
of
inference
93
They
are
definitory
rules
which
determine
whether
an
inference
is
correct
or
which
inferences
are
allowed
Definitory
rules
contrast
with
strategic
rules
Strategic
rules
specify
which
inferential
moves
are
necessary
to
reach
a
given
conclusion
based
on
a
set
of
premises
This
distinction
does
not
just
apply
to
logic
but
also
to
games
In
chess
for
example
the
definitory
rules
dictate
that
bishops
may
only
move
diagonally
The
strategic
rules
on
the
other
hand
describe
how
the
allowed
moves
may
be
used
to
win
a
game
for
instance
by
controlling
the
center
and
by
defending
one's
king
94
It
has
been
argued
that
logicians
should
give
more
emphasis
to
strategic
rules
since
they
are
highly
relevant
for
effective
reasoning
93
Formal
systems
edit
Main
article
Formal
system
A
formal
system
of
logic
consists
of
a
formal
language
together
with
a
set
of
axioms
and
a
proof
system
used
to
draw
inferences
from
these
axioms
95
In
logic
axioms
are
statements
that
are
accepted
without
proof
They
are
used
to
justify
other
statements
96
Some
theorists
also
include
a
semantics
that
specifies
how
the
expressions
of
the
formal
language
relate
to
real
objects
97
Starting
in
the
late
19
th
century
many
new
formal
systems
have
been
proposed
98
A
formal
language
consists
of
an
alphabet
and
syntactic
rules
The
alphabet
is
the
set
of
basic
symbols
used
in
expressions
The
syntactic
rules
determine
how
these
symbols
may
be
arranged
to
result
in
well-formed
formulas

A

sound
when

cannot
derive

from
a
set

unless

A
system
is
complete
when
its
proof
system
can
derive
every

that
is

its

In
other
words
its

can
lead

Thus
soundness

together

103
Systems
of
logic
edit
Systems
of
logic
are
theoretical
frameworks
for
assessing
the
correctness
of
reasoning
and
arguments
For
over
two
thousand
years
Aristotelian
logic
was
treated
as
the
canon
of
logic
in
the
Western
world
104
but
modern
developments
in
this
field
have
led
to
a
vast
proliferation
of
logical
systems
105
One
prominent
categorization
divides
modern
formal
logical
systems
into
classical
logic
extended
logics
and
deviant
logics
106
Aristotelian
edit
Main
article
Aristotelian
logic
Aristotelian
logic
encompasses
a
great
variety
of
topics
They
include
metaphysical
theses
about
ontological
categories
and
problems
of
scientific
explanation
But
in
a
more
narrow
sense
it
is
identical
to
term
logic
or
syllogistics
A
syllogism
is
a
form
of
argument
involving
three
propositions
two
premises
and
a
conclusion
Each
proposition
has
three
essential
parts
a
subject
a
predicate
and
a
copula
connecting
the
subject
to
the
predicate
107
For
example
the
proposition
Socrates
is
wise
is
made
up
of
the
subject
Socrates
the
predicate
wise
and
the
copula
is
108
The
subject
and
the
predicate
are
the
terms
of
the
proposition
Aristotelian
logic
does
not
contain
complex
propositions
made
up
of
simple
propositions
It
differs
in
this
aspect
from
propositional
logic
in
which
any
two
propositions
can
be
linked
using
a
logical
connective
like
and
to
form
a
new
complex
proposition
109
Diagram
of
the
square
of
opposition
The
square
of
opposition
is
often
used
to
visualize
the
relations
between
the
four
basic
categorical
propositions
in
Aristotelian
logic
It
shows
for
example
that
the
propositions
All
S
are
P
and
Some
S
are
not
P
are
contradictory
meaning
that
one
of
them
has
to
be
true
while
the
other
is
false
In
Aristotelian
logic
the
subject
can
be
universal
particular
indefinite
or
singular
For
example
the
term
all
humans
is
a
universal
subject
in
the
proposition
all
humans
are
mortal
A
similar
proposition
could
be
formed
by
replacing
it
with
the
particular
term
some
humans
the
indefinite
term
a
human
or
the
singular
term
Socrates
110
Aristotelian
logic
only
includes
predicates
for
simple
properties
of
entities
But
it
lacks
predicates
corresponding
to
relations
between
entities
111
The
predicate
can
be
linked
to
the
subject
in
two
ways
either
by
affirming
it
or
by
denying
it
112
For
example
the
proposition
Socrates
is
not
a
cat
involves
the
denial
of
the
predicate
cat
to
the
subject
Socrates
Using
combinations
of
subjects
and
predicates
a
great
variety
of
propositions
and
syllogisms
can
be
formed
Syllogisms
are
characterized
by
the
fact
that
the
premises
are
linked
to
each
other
and
to
the
conclusion
by
sharing
one
predicate
in
each
case
113
Thus
these
three
propositions
contain
three
predicates
referred
to
as
major
term
minor
term
and
middle
term
114
The
central
aspect
of
Aristotelian
logic
involves
classifying
all
possible
syllogisms
into
valid
and
invalid
arguments
according
to
how
the
propositions
are
formed
112
115
For
example
the
syllogism
all
men
are
mortal
Socrates
is
a
man
therefore
Socrates
is
mortal
is
valid
The
syllogism
all
cats
are
mortal
Socrates
is
mortal
therefore
Socrates
is
a
cat
on
the
other
hand
is
invalid
116
Classical
edit
Main
article
Classical
logic
Classical
logic
is
distinct
from
traditional
or
Aristotelian
logic
It
encompasses
propositional
logic
and
first-order
logic
It
is
classical
in
the
sense
that
it
is
based
on
basic
logical
intuitions
shared
by
most
logicians
117
These
intuitions
include
the
law
of
excluded
middle
the
double
negation
elimination
the
principle
of
explosion
and
the
bivalence
of
truth
118
It
was
originally
developed
to
analyze
mathematical
arguments
and
was
only
later
applied
to
other
fields
as
well
Because
of
this
focus
on
mathematics
it
does
not
include
logical
vocabulary
relevant
to
many
other
topics
of
philosophical
importance
Examples
of
concepts
it
overlooks
are
the
contrast
between
necessity
and
possibility
and
the
problem
of
ethical
obligation
and
permission
Similarly
it
does
not
address
the
relations
between
past
present
and
future
119
Such
issues
are
addressed
by
extended
logics
They
build
on
the
basic
intuitions
of
classical
logic
and
expand
it
by
introducing
new
logical
vocabulary
This
way
the
exact
logical
approach
is
applied
to
fields
like
ethics
or
epistemology
that
lie
beyond
the
scope
of
mathematics

Propositional
logic

Propositional
logic
comprises
formal
systems
in
which
formulae
are
built
from
atomic
propositions
using

Unlike
predicate
logic
where
terms
and
predicates
are
the
smallest
units
propositional
logic
takes
full
propositions
with
truth
values
as
its
most
basic
component
121
Thus
propositional
logics
can
only
represent
logical
relationships
that
arise
from
the
way
complex
propositions
are
built
from
simpler
ones
But
it
cannot
represent
inferences
that
result
from
the
inner
structure
of
a
proposition

Other
forms
of
modal
logic
introduce
similar
symbols
but
associate
different
meanings
with
them
to
apply
modal
logic
to
other
fields
For
example
deontic
logic
concerns
the
field
of
ethics
and
introduces
symbols
to
express
the
ideas
of
obligation
and
permission
i.e
to
describe
whether
an
agent
has
to
perform
a
certain
action
or
is
allowed
to
perform
it
129
The
modal
operators
in
temporal
modal
logic
articulate
temporal
relations
They
can
be
used
to
express
for
example
that
something
happened
at
one
time
or
that
something
is
happening
all
the
time
129
In
epistemology
epistemic
modal
logic
is
used
to
represent
the
ideas
of
knowing
something
in
contrast
to
merely
believing
it
to
be
the
case

But
it

drawbacks
in

Deviant

Main

Deviant
logic
Deviant
logics
are
logical
systems
that
reject
some
of
the
basic
intuitions
of
classical
logic
Because
of
this
they
are
usually
seen
not
as
its
supplements
but
as
its
rivals
Deviant
logical
systems
differ
from
each
other
either
because
they
reject
different
classical
intuitions
or
because
they
propose
different
alternatives
to
the
same
issue
134
Intuitionistic
logic
is
a
restricted
version
of
classical
logic
135
It
uses
the
same
symbols
but
excludes
some
rules
of
inference
For
example
according
to
the
law
of
double
negation
elimination
if
a
sentence
is
not
not
true
then
it
is
true

Another
classical
principle
not
part
of

logic
is
the
law
of

It
states
that

These
deviations
from
classical
logic
are
based
on
the
idea
that
truth
is
established
by
verification
using
a
proof
Intuitionistic
logic
is
especially
prominent
in
the
field
of
constructive
mathematics
which
emphasizes
the
need
to
find
or
construct
a
specific
example
to
prove
its
existence
136
Multi-valued
logics
depart
from
classicality
by
rejecting
the
principle
of
bivalence
which
requires
all
propositions
to
be
either
true
or
false
For
instance
Jan
Łukasiewicz
and
Stephen
Cole
Kleene
both
proposed
ternary
logics
which
have
a
third
truth
value
representing
that
a
statement's
truth
value
is
indeterminate
137
These
logics
have
been
applied
in
the
field
of
linguistics
Fuzzy
logics
are
multivalued
logics
that
have
an
infinite
number
of
degrees
of
truth
represented
by
a
real
number
between
0
and
1
138
Paraconsistent
logics
are
logical
systems
that
can
deal
with
contradictions
They
are
formulated
to
avoid
the
principle
of
explosion
for
them
it
is
not
the
case
that
anything
follows
from
a
contradiction
139
They
are
often
motivated
by
dialetheism
the
view
that
contradictions
are
real
or
that
reality
itself
is
contradictory
Graham
Priest

Informal
edit
Main
article
Informal
logic
Informal
logic
is
usually
carried
out
in
a
less
systematic
way
It
often
focuses
on
more
specific
issues
like
investigating
a
particular
type
of
fallacy
or
studying
a
certain
aspect
of
argumentation
Nonetheless
some
frameworks
of
informal
logic
have
also
been
presented
that
try
to
provide
a
systematic
characterization
of
the
correctness
of
arguments
141
The
pragmatic
or
dialogical
approach
to
informal
logic
sees
arguments
as
speech
acts
and
not
merely
as
a
set
of
premises
together
with
a
conclusion
142
As
speech
acts
they
occur
in
a
certain
context
like
a
dialogue
which
affects
the
standards
of
right
and
wrong
arguments
143
A
prominent
version
by
Douglas
N
Walton
understands
a
dialogue
as
a
game
between
two
players
The
initial
position
of
each
player
is
characterized
by
the
propositions
to
which
they
are
committed
and
the
conclusion
they
intend
to
prove
Dialogues
are
games
of
persuasion
each
player
has
the
goal
of
convincing
the
opponent
of
their
own
conclusion
144
This
is
achieved
by
making
arguments
arguments
are
the
moves
of
the
game
145
They
affect
to
which
propositions
the
players
are
committed
A
winning
move
is
a
successful
argument
that
takes
the
opponent's
commitments
as
premises
and
shows
how
one's
own
conclusion
follows
from
them
This
is
usually
not
possible
straight
away
For
this
reason
it
is
normally
necessary
to
formulate
a
sequence
of
arguments
as
intermediary
steps
each
of
which
brings
the
opponent
a
little
closer
to
one's
intended
conclusion
Besides
these
positive
arguments
leading
one
closer
to
victory
there
are
also
negative
arguments
preventing
the
opponent's
victory
by
denying
their
conclusion
144
Whether
an
argument
is
correct
depends
on
whether
it
promotes
the
progress
of
the
dialogue
Fallacies
on
the
other
hand
are
violations
of
the
standards
of
proper
argumentative
rules
146
These
standards
also
depend
on
the
type
of
dialogue
For
example
the
standards
governing
the
scientific
discourse
differ
from
the
standards
in
business
negotiations
147
The
epistemic
approach
to
informal
logic
on
the
other
hand
focuses
on
the
epistemic
role
of
arguments
148
It
is
based
on
the
idea
that
arguments
aim
to
increase
our
knowledge
They
achieve
this
by
linking
justified
beliefs
to
beliefs
that
are
not
yet
justified
149
Correct
arguments
succeed
at
expanding
knowledge
while
fallacies
are
epistemic
failures
they
do
not
justify
the
belief
in
their
conclusion
150
For
example
the
fallacy
of
begging
the
question
is
a
fallacy
because
it
fails
to
provide
independent
justification
for
its
conclusion
even
though
it
is
deductively
valid
151
In
this
sense
logical
normativity
consists
in
epistemic
success
or
rationality
149
The
Bayesian
approach
is
one
example
of
an
epistemic
approach
152
Central
to
Bayesianism
is
not
just
whether
the
agent
believes
something
but
the
degree
to
which
they
believe
it
the
so-called
credence
Degrees
of
belief
are
seen
as
subjective
probabilities
in
the
believed
proposition
i.e
how
certain
the
agent
is
that
the
proposition
is
true
153
On
this
view
reasoning
can
be
interpreted
as
a
process
of
changing
one's
credences
often
in
reaction
to
new
incoming
information
154
Correct
reasoning
and
the
arguments
it
is
based
on
follow
the
laws
of
probability
for
example
the
principle
of
conditionalization
Bad
or
irrational
reasoning
on
the
other
hand
violates
these
laws
155
Areas
of
research
edit
Logic
is
studied
in
various
fields
In
many
cases
this
is
done
by
applying
its
formal
method
to
specific
topics
outside
its
scope
like
to
ethics
or
computer
science
156
In
other
cases
logic
itself
is
made
the
subject
of
research
in
another
discipline
This
can
happen
in
diverse
ways
For
instance
it
can
involve
investigating
the
philosophical
assumptions
linked
to
the
basic
concepts
used
by
logicians
Other
ways
include
interpreting
and
analyzing
logic
through
mathematical
structures
as
well
as
studying
and
comparing
abstract
properties
of
formal
logical
systems
157
Philosophy

edit
Main

Philosophy
of
logic
and
Philosophical
logic
Philosophy
of
logic
is
the
philosophical
discipline
studying
the
scope
and
nature
of
logic
59
It
examines
many
presuppositions
implicit
in
logic
like
how
to
define
its
basic
concepts
or
the
metaphysical
assumptions
associated
with
them
158
It
is
also
concerned
with
how
to
classify
logical
systems
and
considers
the
ontological
commitments
they
incur
159
Philosophical
logic
is
one
of
the
areas
within
the
philosophy
of
logic
It
studies
the
application
of
logical
methods
to
philosophical
problems
in
fields
like
metaphysics
ethics
and
epistemology
160
This
application
usually
happens
in
the
form
of
extended
or
deviant
logical
systems
161
Metalogic
edit
Main
article
Metalogic
Metalogic
is
the
field
of
inquiry
studying
the
properties
of
formal
logical
systems
For
example
when
a
new
formal
system
is
developed
metalogicians
may
study
it
to
determine
which
formulas
can
be
proven
in
it
They
may
also
study
whether
an
algorithm
could
be
developed
to
find
a
proof
for
each
formula
and
whether
every
provable
formula
in
it
is
a
tautology
Finally
they
may
compare
it
to
other
logical
systems
to
understand
its
distinctive
features
A
key
issue
in
metalogic
concerns
the
relation
between
syntax
and
semantics
The
syntactic
rules
of
a
formal
system
determine
how
to
deduce
conclusions
from
premises
i.e
how
to
formulate
proofs
The
semantics
of
a
formal
system
governs
which
sentences
are
true
and
which
ones
are
false
This
determines
the
validity
of
arguments
since
for
valid
arguments
it
is
impossible
for
the
premises
to
be
true
and
the
conclusion
to
be
false
The
relation
between
syntax
and
semantics
concerns
issues
like
whether
every
valid
argument
is
provable
and
whether
every
provable
argument
is
valid
Metalogicians
also
study
whether
logical
systems
are
complete
sound
and
consistent
They
are
interested
in
whether
the
systems
are
decidable
and
what
expressive
power
they
have
Metalogicians
usually
rely
heavily
on
abstract
mathematical
reasoning
when
examining
and
formulating
metalogical
proofs
This
way
they
aim
to
arrive
at
precise
and
general
conclusions
on
these
topics

The
term
mathematical
logic
is
sometimes
used
as
a
synonym
of
formal
logic
But
in
a
more
restricted
sense
it
refers
to
the
study
of
logic
within
mathematics
Major
subareas
include
model
theory
proof
theory
set
theory
and
computability
theory
164
Research
in
mathematical
logic
commonly
addresses
the
mathematical
properties
of
formal
systems
of
logic
However
it
can
also
include
attempts
to
use
logic
to
analyze
mathematical
reasoning
or
to
establish
logic-based
foundations
of
mathematics
165
The
latter
was
a
major
concern
in
early
20
th-century
mathematical
logic
which
pursued
the
program
of
logicism
pioneered
by
philosopher-logicians
such
as
Gottlob
Frege
Alfred
North
Whitehead
and
Bertrand
Russell
Mathematical
theories
were
supposed
to
be
logical
tautologies
and
their
program
was
to
show
this
by
means
of
a
reduction
of
mathematics
to
logic
Many
attempts
to
realize
this
program
failed
from
the
crippling
of
Frege's
project
in
his
Grundgesetze
by
Russell's
paradox
to
the
defeat
of
Hilbert's
program
by
Gödel's
incompleteness
theorems
166
Set
theory
originated
in
the
study
of
the
infinite
by
Georg
Cantor
and
it
has
been
the
source
of
many
of
the
most
challenging
and
important
issues
in
mathematical
logic
They
include
Cantor's
theorem
the
status
of
the
Axiom
of
Choice
the
question
of
the
independence
of
the
continuum
hypothesis
and
the
modern
debate
on
large
cardinal
axioms
167
Computability
theory
is
the
branch
of
mathematical
logic
that
studies
effective
procedures
to
solve
calculation
problems
One
of
its
main
goals
is
to
understand
whether
it
is
possible
to
solve
a
given
problem
using
an
algorithm
For
instance
given
a
certain
claim
about
the
positive
integers
it
examines
whether
an
algorithm
can
be
found
to
determine
if
this
claim
is
true
Computability
theory
uses
various
theoretical
tools
and
models
such
as
Turing
machines
to
explore
this
type
of
issue

using

This

169
Logic
programming
languages
are
designed
specifically
to
express
facts
using
logical
formulas
and
to
draw
inferences
from
these
facts
For
example
Prolog
is
a
logic
programming
language
based
on
predicate
logic
170
Computer
scientists
also
apply
concepts
from
logic
to
problems
in
computing
The
works
of
Claude
Shannon
were
influential
in
this
regard
He
showed
how
Boolean
logic
can
be
used
to
understand
and
implement
computer
circuits
171
This
can
be
achieved
using
electronic
logic
gates
i.e
electronic
circuits
with
one
or
more
inputs
and
usually
one
output
The
truth
values
of
propositions
are
represented
by
voltage
levels
In
this
way
logic
functions
can
be
simulated
by
applying
the
corresponding
voltages
to
the
inputs
of
the
circuit
and
determining
the
value
of
the
function
by
measuring
the
voltage
of
the
output

Formal

natural
language
Formal
semantics
is
a
subfield
of
logic
linguistics
and
the
philosophy
of
language
The
discipline
of
semantics
studies
the
meaning
of
language
Formal
semantics
uses
formal
tools
from
the
fields
of
symbolic
logic
and
mathematics
to
give
precise
theories
of
the
meaning
of
natural
language
expressions
It
understands
meaning
usually
in
relation
to
truth
conditions
i.e
it
examines
in
which
situations
a
sentence
would
be
true
or
false
One
of
its
central
methodological
assumptions
is
the
principle
of
compositionality
It
states
that
the
meaning
of
a
complex
expression
is
determined
by
the
meanings
of
its
parts
and
how
they
are
combined
For
example
the
meaning
of
the
verb
phrase
walk
and
sing
depends
on
the
meanings
of
the
individual
expressions
walk
and
sing
Many
theories
in
formal
semantics
rely
on
model
theory
This
means
that
they
employ
set
theory
to
construct
a
model
and
then
interpret
the
meanings
of
expression
in
relation
to
the
elements
in
this
model
For
example
the
term
walk
may
be
interpreted
as
the
set
of
all
individuals
in
the
model
that
share
the
property
of
walking
Early
influential
theorists
in
this
field
were
Richard

Epistemology
of
logic
edit
The
epistemology
of
logic
studies
how
one
knows
that
an
argument
is
valid
or
that
a
proposition
is
logically
true
174
This
includes
questions
like
how
to
justify
that
modus
ponens
is
a
valid
rule
of
inference
or
that
contradictions
are
false
175
The
traditionally
dominant
view
is
that
this
form
of
logical
understanding
belongs
to
knowledge
a
priori
176
In
this
regard
it
is
often
argued
that
the
mind
has
a
special
faculty
to
examine
relations
between
pure
ideas
and
that
this
faculty
is
also
responsible
for
apprehending
logical
truths
177
A
similar
approach
understands
the
rules
of
logic
in
terms
of
linguistic
conventions
On
this
view
the
laws
of
logic
are
trivial
since
they
are
true
by
definition
they
just
express
the
meanings
of
the
logical
vocabulary
178
Some
theorists
like
Hilary
Putnam
and
Penelope
Maddy
object
to
the
view
that
logic
is
knowable
a
priori
They
hold
instead
that
logical
truths
depend
on
the
empirical
world
This
is
usually
combined
with
the
claim
that
the
laws
of
logic
express
universal
regularities
found
in
the
structural
features
of
the
world
According
to
this
view
they
may
be
explored
by
studying
general
patterns
of
the
fundamental
sciences
For
example
it
has
been
argued
that
certain
insights
of
quantum
mechanics
refute
the
principle
of
distributivity
in
classical
logic
which
states
that

for
the
thesis
that

is
the
correct
logical
system
and
should
replace
classical
logic

scholarly
thought
181
and
Gottlob
Frege
one
of
the
founders
of
modern
symbolic
logic
182
Logic
was
developed
independently
in
several
cultures
during
antiquity
One
major
early
contributor
was
Aristotle
who
developed
term
logic
in
his
Organon
and
Prior
Analytics
183
He
was
responsible
for
the
introduction
of
the
hypothetical
syllogism
184
and
temporal
modal
logic
185
Further
innovations
include
inductive
logic
186
as
well
as
the
discussion
of
new
logical
concepts
such
as
terms
predicables
syllogisms
and
propositions
Aristotelian
logic
was
highly
regarded
in
classical
and
medieval
times
both
in
Europe
and
the
Middle
East
It
remained
in
wide
use
in
the
West
until
the
early
19
th
century
187
It
has
now
been
superseded
by
later
work
though
many
of
its
key
insights
are
still
present
in
modern
systems
of
logic
188
Ibn
Sina
Avicenna
was
the
founder
of
Avicennian
logic
which
replaced
Aristotelian
logic
as
the
dominant
system
of
logic
in
the
Islamic
world
189
It
influenced
Western
medieval
writers
such
as
Albertus
Magnus
and
William
of
Ockham
190
Ibn
Sina
wrote
on
the
hypothetical
syllogism
191
and
on
the
propositional
calculus
192
He
developed
an
original
temporally
modalized
syllogistic
theory
involving
temporal
logic
and
modal
logic
193
He
also
made
use
of
inductive
logic
such
as
his
methods
of
agreement
difference
and
concomitant
variation
which
are
critical
to
the
scientific
method
191
Fakhr
al-Din
al-Razi
was
another
influential
Muslim
logician
He
criticized
Aristotelian
syllogistics
and
formulated
an
early
system
of
inductive
logic
foreshadowing
the
system
of
inductive
logic
developed
by
John
Stuart
Mill
194
During
the
Middle
Ages
many
translations
and
interpretations
of
Aristotelian
logic
were
made
The
works
of
Boethius
were
particularly
influential
Besides
translating
Aristotle's
work
into
Latin
he
also
produced
textbooks
on
logic
195
Later
the
works
of
Islamic
philosophers
such
as
Ibn
Sina
and
Ibn
Rushd
Averroes
were
drawn
on
This
expanded
the
range
of
ancient
works
available
to
medieval
Christian
scholars
since
more
Greek
work
was
available
to
Muslim
scholars
that
had
been
preserved
in
Latin
commentaries
In
1323
William
of
Ockham's
influential
Summa
Logicae
was
released
It
is
a
comprehensive
treatise
on
logic
that
discusses
many
basic
concepts
of
logic
and
provides
a
systematic
exposition
of
types
of
propositions
and
their
truth
conditions
196
In
Chinese
philosophy
the
School
of
Names
and
Mohism
were
particularly
influential
The
School
of
Names
focused
on
the
use
of
language
and
on
paradoxes
For
example
Gongsun
Long
proposed
the
white
horse
paradox
which
defends
the
thesis
that
a
white
horse
is
not
a
horse
The
school
of
Mohism
also
acknowledged
the
importance
of
language
for
logic
and
tried
to
relate
the
ideas
in
these
fields
to
the
realm
of
ethics
197
In
India
the
study
of
logic
was
primarily
pursued
by
the
schools
of
Nyaya
Buddhism
and
Jainism
It
was
not
treated
as
a
separate
academic
discipline
and
discussions
of
its
topics
usually
happened
in
the
context
of
epistemology
and
theories
of
dialogue
or
argumentation
198
In
Nyaya
inference
is
understood
as
a
source
of
knowledge
pramāṇa
It
follows
the
perception
of
an
object
and
tries
to
arrive
at
conclusions
for
example
about
the
cause
of
this
object
199
A
similar
emphasis
on
the
relation
to
epistemology
is
also
found
in
Buddhist
and
Jainist
schools
of
logic
where
inference
is
used
to
expand
the
knowledge
gained
through
other
sources
200
Some
of
the
later
theories
of
Nyaya
belonging
to
the
Navya-Nyāya
school
resemble
modern
forms
of
logic
such
as
Gottlob
Frege's
distinction
between
sense
and
reference
and
his
definition
of
number
201
The
syllogistic
logic
developed
by
Aristotle
predominated
in
the
West
until
the
mid
19
th
century
when
interest
in
the
foundations
of
mathematics
stimulated
the
development
of
modern
symbolic
logic
202
Many
see
Gottlob
Frege's
Begriffsschrift
as
the
birthplace
of
modern
logic
Gottfried
Wilhelm
Leibniz's
idea
of
a
universal
formal
language
is
often
considered
a
forerunner
Other
pioneers
were
George
Boole
who
invented
Boolean
algebra
as
a
mathematical
system
of
logic
and
Charles
Peirce
who
developed
the
logic
of
relatives
Alfred
North
Whitehead
and
Bertrand
Russell
in
turn
condensed
many
of
these
insights
in
their
work
Principia
Mathematica
Modern
logic
introduced
novel
concepts
such
as
functions
quantifiers
and
relational
predicates
A
hallmark
of
modern
symbolic
logic
is
its
use
of
formal
language
to
precisely
codify
its
insights
In
this
regard
it
departs
from
earlier
logicians
who
relied
mainly
on
natural
language
203
Of
particular
influence
was
the
development
of
first-order
logic
which
is
usually
treated
as
the
standard
system
of
modern
logic
204
Its
analytical
generality
allowed
the
formalization
of
mathematics
and
drove
the
investigation
of
set
theory
It
also
made
Alfred
Tarski's
approach
to
model
theory
possible
and
provided
the
foundation
of
modern
mathematical
logic

What
responsibilities
do
governments
have
for
the
human
rights
of
people
living
under
the
jurisdiction
of
other
states
For
instance
is
there
a
reason
for
intervention
on
humanitarian
grounds
when
a
political
regime
is
i
harming
its
own
citizens
or
ii
unable
to
prevent
harm
imposed
on
its
citizens
by
another
actor
When
given
the
importance
of
state
sovereignty
in
international
law
can
intervention
in
such
cases
be
regarded
as
legal
and
is
there
a
scenario
in
which
it
is
morally
permissible
to
engage
in
illegal
humanitarian
intervention
If
there
is
a
moral
and/or
legal
right
to
intervene
does
this
also
constitute
an
obligation
for
states
to
intervene
The
above
questions
have
now
concerned
scholars
since
the
establishment
of
the
modern
state
in
the
wake
of
the
Westphalian
peace
However
they
still
have
not
lost
any
of
their
urgency
as
situations
continue
to
arise
frequently
in
which
human
rights
violations
are
taking
place
within
the
jurisdiction
of
sovereign
states
For
most
of
this
time
the
debate
revolved
around
the
question
of
permissibility
and
thus
if
intervention
can
be
considered
as
either
a
moral
or
a
legal
right
or
both
Yet
in
recent
years
the
scholarly
dialogue
has
shifted
from
questioning
and/or
positing
a
right
to
intervene
towards
questioning
and/or
positing
a
duty
to
intervene
Bagnoli
2006
118
One
reason
for
why
this
shift
occurred
is
undoubtedly
the
release
of
the
report
by
the
International
Commission
on
Intervention
and
State
Sovereignty
ICISS
1
in
2001
The
Responsibility
to
Protect
R
2
P
and
the
ratification
of
parts
of
it
by
all
member
states
of
the
United
Nations
at
the
2005
World
Summit
2
The
report
develops
the
idea
that
the
notion
of
sovereignty
as
control
meaning
that
a
state
has
total
authority
over
its
own
people
should
be
replaced
by
understanding
sovereignty
as
responsibility
meaning
that
the
state
carries
a
duty
of
safeguarding
the
basic
human
rights
of
its
citizens
ICISS
2001
2

On
this
account
it
follows
that
the
sovereignty
of
a
state
can
be
temporarily
suspended
in
cases
in
which
it
is
rendered
unable
or
is
unwilling
to
meet
its
responsibility
of
protecting
the
human
rights
of
its
citizens
e.g
in
the
case
of
genocide
war
crimes
ethnic
cleansing
and
crimes
against
humanity
In
such
cases
the
responsibility
to
protect
these
citizens
is
automatically
reassigned
to
the
international
community
which
carries
a
responsibility
to
react
that
may
involve
humanitarian
intervention
given
the
fact
that
all
non-military
means
have
been
exhausted
first
ICISS

Pattison
2008

What
is
astonishing
is
the
fact
that
R
2
P
argues
both
that
a
state’s
sovereignty
is
contingent
on
its
ability
to
protect
the
basic
human
rights
of
its
citizens
and
that
intervention
becomes
a
moral
obligation
for
outside
actors
once
a
state
fails
at
upholding
its
responsibility
to
protect
As
a
result
the
report
moves
away
from
regarding
humanitarian
intervention
as
something
that
is
permissible
under
certain
circumstances
a
right
towards
viewing
it
as
a
responsibility
that
falls
on
the
international
society
a
duty
Pattison
2008
263
Pattison
2013
571
In
this
regard
however
the
report
does
not
explain
why
an
intervention
just
by
virtue
of
being
permissible
also
generates
a
duty
that
obliges
international
society
to
protect
Instead
it
simply
assumes
that
this
international
responsibility
to
protect
arises
once
the
principle
of
non-intervention
is
overridden
Tan
2006
88
There
is
obviously
a
gap
in
this
reasoning
In
order
to
posit
a
duty
to
protect
human
rights
that
yields
an
obligation
for
states
to
intervene
in
the
affairs
of
other
states
there
has
to
be
proof
of
a
positive
duty
3
created
by
these
rights
that
applies
to
all
states
in
the
same
way
However
I
believe
that
one
can
certainly
produce
the
proof
that
is
missing
here
In
order
to
evidence
my
assertion
I
will
present
a
constructivist
argument
for
i
why
it
makes
sense
to
replace
the
notion
of
sovereignty
as
control
with
sovereignty
as
responsibility
and
ii
for
why
intervention
becomes
a
duty
that
falls
on
international
society
once
we
acknowledge
the
political
reality
of
i
Following
from
this
I
am
going
to
explain
that
states
should
intervene
in
the
affairs
of
other
states
in
order
to
defend
human
rights
My
argument
proceeds
in
three
steps
First
by
comparing
realist
liberal
and
constructivist
conceptions
of
human
rights
I
will
show
how
the
constructivist
understanding
is
the
only
one
of
the
big
three
metatheories
that
acknowledges
the
political
reality
of
human
rights
that
is
defining
standards
of
conduct
applicable
to
political
arrangements
Second
I
will
show
that
sovereignty
can
be
thought
of
in
a
similar
way
to
human
rights
which
means
that
it
also
has
a
functional
political
reality
that
must
be
recognised
Here
drawing
on
the
work
of
Christian
Reus-Smit
I
will
explain
that
the
function
it
fulfils
is
guarding
the
moral
purpose
of
the
state
which
is
the
protection
of
human
rights
This
enables
me
to
prove
that
the
political
realities
of
human
rights
and
sovereignty
are
co-dependent
Finally
as
a
third
step
I
will
explain
how
this
co-dependency
yields
a
positive
duty
on
the
side
of
international
society
to
intervene
in
the
affairs
of
sovereign
states
to
protect
human
rights
In
this
regard
I
will
further
present
evidence
for
why
discharging
such
duty
can
also
happen
for
practical
instead
of
moral
reasons
whereby
I
am
going
to
provide
two
examples
i
status
enhancement
and
ii
prevention
of
international
insecurity
Sovereignty
as
Responsibility
i
How
should
human
rights
be
conceived
Let
us
begin
by
taking
a
closer
look
at
what
can
be
termed
the
realist
perspective
of
human
rights
In
this
regard
it
is
important
to
note
first
that
realists
themselves
have
paid
very
little
attention
to
human
rights
For
this
lack
of
interest
there
are
at
least
two
reasons
First
of
all
realists
understand
human
rights
as
being
part
of
ethics
and
thus
belonging
to
domestic
politics
the
working
of
which
they
regard
to
be
diametrically
opposed
to
international
politics
Casla
2018
143
This
assumption
is
closely
tied
to
the
realist
notion
of
the
international
realm
being
characterised
by
anarchy
and
thus
an
environment
in
which
ethics
has
no
place
meaning
that
an
act
being
right
or
wrong
only
depends
on
the
result
of
the
act
itself
As
a
consequence
the
realist
tradition
has
tended
to
view
human
rights
as
a
secondary
state
goal
that
is
subordinate
to
security
Wagner
2014
2
4
A
second
reason
is
that
realists
are
generally
sceptical
towards
the
concept
of
international
law
Morgenthau
1940
Krasner
2002
and
the
idea
that
there
is
something
akin
to
a
universal
morality
that
could
figure
as
a
bedrock
for
an
international
legal
regime
that
incorporates
the
protection
of
human
rights
Morgenthau
1948
Realists
consider
such
aspects
of
international
politics
to
be
simply
epiphenomenal
which
means
that
they
mirror
the
balance
of
power
but
do
not
restrict
or
shape
state
behaviour
referring
to
the
fact
that
norms
get
subsumed
in
the
material
structure
of
the
international
system
Mearsheimer
1995
91
Accordingly
realists
argue
that
states
may
establish
and
enforce
international
legal
norms
and
institutions
to
protect
human
rights
yet
that
it
is
not
the
norms
themselves
that
shape
the
particular
way
in
which
a
state
acts
but
instead
it
is
the
underlying
material
interests
and
power
relations
that
determine
the
state’s
behaviour
Slaughter
2011
Their
scepticism
thus
stems
first
and
foremost
from
a
worry
that
admonitions
to
obey
such
legal
and
institutional
norms
might
be
used
malevolently
by
states
to
hide
the
pursuit
of
narrow
selfish
interests
Dunne
and
Hanson
2016
63
Donnelly
1999
In
this
sense
realists
criticise
human
rights
policies
for
inevitably
having
a
tendency
to
be
selective
and
biased
5
For
example
states
might
stress
the
significance
of
human
rights
when
dealing
with
some
states
but
not
with
others
with
whom
they
have
certain
kinds
of
links
e.g
close
trade
relations
This
shows
the
objection
runs
that
states
are
self-interested
actors
that
inevitably
take
a
partial
approach
to
further
their
own
goals
illustrating
that
they
are
not
really
ever
worried
about
human
rights
Caney
2005
93
94
Consequently
realists
regard
human
rights
and
individuals
interests
as
largely
peripheral
to
international
relations
They
perceive
of
morality
as
an
appropriate
standard
for
judging
individual
relations
but
not
the
relations
of
states
as
the
latter
remains
to
be
governed
by
the
logic
of
power
and
interest
It
follows
that
from
a
realist
perspective
individuals
are
objects
rather
than
subjects
of
international
politics
Thus
they
certainly
have
no
claim
beyond
a
moral
claim
on
other
states
or
international
society
which
is
why
the
most
that
they
can
hope
for
is
that
their
own
state
will
act
on
their
behalf
Donnelly
1993
617
However
if
human
rights
are
secondary
to
the
study
of
international
relations
as
they
do
not
determine
state
behaviour
but
only
figure
as
a
veil
behind
which
states
can
hide
their
self-interest
why
would
these
states
adopt
something
like
R
2
P
which
ultimately
waves
the
irrevocability
of
the
principle
of
non-intervention
which
is
at
the
heart
of
realism
thus
forfeiting
some
of
their
sovereignty
in
the
name
of
human
rights
Moreover
if
states
are
pursuing
their
interests
in
anarchic
conditions
why
would
they
be
concerned
with
their
legitimacy
from
a
human
rights
perspectives
as
evidenced
by
jointly
establishing
human
rights
bodies
at
the
international
and
regional
level
and
endowing
these
bodies
with
rights
to
enforcement
6
In
this
regard
it
appears
human
rights
have
proven
to
be
anything
but
marginal
to
international
relations
as
their
repeated
violation
has
triggered
debates
questioning
the
limit
of
state
rule
over
society
and
national
sovereignty
Accordingly
human
rights
issues
even
pose
a
particularly
potent
challenge
to
the
central
logic
of
a
system
of
independent
sovereign
states
under
anarchy
and
thus
to
one
of
the
key
assumptions
of
realism
whereby
such
development
cannot
be
explained
by
a
logic
of
self-interest
Sikkink
1998
517
Then
since
the
realist
perspective
ignores
the
fact
that
human
rights
matter
for
the
study
of
international
relations
in
so
far
as
they
seem
to
be
able
to
drive
and/or
shape
state
behaviour
it
is
now
time
to
consider
a
second
approach
that
is
more
sensitive
towards
this
reality
liberalism
While
liberal
thinking
differs
the
central
idea
is
that
individuals
have
a
set
of
basic
rights
that
they
enjoy
by
virtue
of
being
human
7
Accordingly
the
liberal
perspective
of
human
rights
adopts
what
has
been
termed
moral
universalism
On
this
view
there
are
some
moral
values
that
are
valid
across
the
world
If
X
is
morally
universal
then
X
applies
to
all
persons
Thus
the
liberal
perspective
considers
defending
human
rights
as
defending
natural
claims
of
human
beings
It
follows
that
for
adherents
of
the
liberal
perspective
the
function
of
human
rights
can
be
separated
from
the
existing
political
reality
of
human
rights
Then
to
determine
whether
X
qualifies
as
a
human
right
one
does
not
need
to
look
at
the
purpose
X
is
supposed
to
serve
in
real-world
politics
Rather
one
only
needs
to
consider
if
X
is
a
normatively
salient
interest
attached
to
our
status
as
human
beings
that
is
profound
enough
to
place
a
duty
of
respect
and
protection
on
others
Valentini

As
evidence
for
this
conception
liberals
point
to
the
fact
that
moral
universalism
has
been
increasingly
embedded
into
the
practice
of
international
politics
since
the
birth
of
the
Enlightenment
Starting
off
from
Europe
over
time
the
rights
of
citizens
became
enshrined
in
legal
constitutions
all
over
the
world
the
slave
trade
was
abolished
and
criminalised
workers
rights
became
acknowledged
and
international
humanitarian
law
was
expanded
These
advances
finally
became
codified
in
the
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
UDHR
in
1948
which
is
regarded
by
liberals
as
the
ratification
or
rather
the
acknowledgement
of
the
existence
of
moral
universalism
Dunne
and
Hanson
2016
63
The
liberal
conception
of
human
rights
however
suffers
from
a
serious
weakness
namely
the
fact
that
it
is
insensitive
towards
the
function
of
human
rights
As
Valentini
explains
human
rights
are
a
political-legal
construct
that
emerged
under
particular
circumstances
and
which
places
constraints
primarily
on
the
conduct
of
states
and
their
officials
rather
than
on
that
of
individuals
Valentini
2012
a
576
However
on
the
liberal
perspective
this
functional
reality
gets
lost
as
it
assumes
human
rights
to
be
something
that
exists
independently
of
the
relationship
between
states
and
individuals
Thus
the
liberal
perspective
regards
the
implementation
of
these
rights
as
a
moral
obligation
rather
than
an
illustration
of
a
particular
consensus
that
exists
among
actors
and
institutions
in
international
society
and
which
has
some
function
that
is
to
define
standards
of
conduct
applicable
to
political
arrangements
That
the
latter
instead
of
the
former
is
the
political
reality
was
probably
illustrated
best
by
Hannah
Arendt’s
reflections
on
the
refugees
and
rejects
that
have
been
expelled
from
their
political
communities
as
a
consequence
of
World
War
II
The
conception
of
human
rights
based
upon
the
assumed
existence
of
a
human
being
as
such
broke
down
at
the
very
moment
when
those
who
professed
to
believe
in
it
were
for
the
first
time
confronted
with
people
who
had
indeed
lost
all
other
qualities
and
specific
relationships
except
that
they
were
still
human
The
world
found
nothing
sacred
in
the
abstract
nakedness
of
being
human
Hannah
Arendt
1951

Thus
it
seems
that
human
rights
matter
only
in
the
context
of
political
arrangements
such
as
states
and
that
individuals
are
deprived
of
them
once
they
are
failed
by
these
arrangements
This
again
highlights
the
political
reality
of
human
rights
i.e
serving
a
function
as
these
rights
predominantly
matter
for
the
conduct
of
the
state
towards
its
citizens
or
in
the
case
when
a
state
breaks
down
or
is
threatened
by
civil
war
A
further
illustration
of
this
reality
can
be
provided
by
the
fact
that
many
of
the
rights
postulated
by
the
UDHR
have
a
limited
scope
that
only
applies
to
the
territory
of
the
state
to
which
the
right
holder
belongs
or
in
which
she
resides

Consequently
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
liberal
perspective
is
also
an
insufficient
starting
point
for
considering
if
states
should
intervene
in
the
affairs
of
other
states
in
order
to
protect
human
rights
as
it
ignores
the
reality
of
human
rights
in
international
relations
What
is
needed
is
a
theory
that
is
sensitive
towards
this
reality
and
which
does
not
disregard
human
rights
as
marginal
or
insignificant
the
way
realism
does
This
theory
as
I
will
argue
is
constructivism
Constructivists
perceive
of
international
norms
as
shared
understandings
as
to
the
permissible
limits
of
state
action
and
an
acceptance
that
conduct
should
be
justified
and
appraised
in
terms
of
that
norm
Wheeler
2002

In
this
regard
they
are
viewed
as
having
a
social
ontological
character
meaning
that
they
are
social
rather
than
natural
facts
Accordingly
the
application
of
international
norms
is
regarded
as
a
social
construction
co-constituted
by
the
members
of
international
society
Kuo
2014
79
Viewing
international
politics
according
to
this
dynamic
is
helpful
for
understanding
the
development
of
human
rights
Similar
to
social
life
the
international
realm
is
constituted
by
a
variety
of
contending
sets
of
expectations
as
to
how
actors
ought
to
behave
Dunne
Hanson
2016
64
Adopting
a
terminology
created
by
John
Rawls
the
rules
of
conduct
that
are
reached
despite
this
disunity
can
be
referred
to
as
an
overlapping
consensus
What
is
meant
by
this
with
regard
to
human
rights
is
that
people
of
different
faiths
or
secular
traditions
what
Rawls
refers
to
as
comprehensive
doctrines
can
still
and
do
converge
on
some
common
moral
values
They
thus
reach
an
overlapping
consensus
on
a
set
of
human
rights
even
though
they
disagree
on
as
to
which
moral
theory
is
the
most
plausible
to
ground
these
rights
Caney
2005
29
Donnelly
2007
Such
consensus
then
is
political
rather
than
moral
or
religious
which
means
that
it
is
socially
constructed
rather
than
by
nature
of
human
rights
itself
Understanding
human
rights
in
this
sense
constructivists
then
argue
that
the
inter-state
order
can
be
transformed
by
the
social
construction
of
norms
as
their
acceptance
establishes
that
conduct
should
be
justified
and
appraised
in
terms
of
these
norms
and
has
in
fact
been
transformed
in
this
way
by
the
emergence
of
a
consensus
on
universal
human
rights
in
the
form
of
the
UDHR
this
will
become
apparent
in
the
next
section
Dunne
Hanson
2016
64
Thus
constructivism
acknowledges
both
the
fact
that
human
rights
are
an
integral
part
of
international
relations
and
the
fact
that
these
rights
are
first
and
foremost
political
insofar
that
they
fulfil
a
function
that
is
to
define
standards
of
conduct
applicable
to
political
arrangements
Having
established
the
political
reality
of
human
rights
in
this
way
it
is
now
time
to
take
an
in-depth
look
at
sovereignty
in
order
to
examine
how
it
relates
to
the
former
ii
The
co-dependency
of
human
rights
and
sovereignty
Recall
the
fact
that
the
political
reality
of
human
rights
is
one
of
a
social
construct
that
is
fulfilling
a
specific
function
which
is
defining
standards
of
conduct
applicable
to
political
arrangements
Continuing
to
adopt
a
constructivist
perspective
one
can
think
of
sovereignty
in
the
same
way
Although
sovereignty
and
especially
anarchy
were
once
taken
as
enduring
facts
of
the
international
realm
a
number
of
authors
has
now
shown
that
they
are
better
understood
as
social
facts
Searle
1995
or
social
kinds
Bhaskar
1979
Wendt
1999
that
is
social
constructs
that
are
produced
and
reproduced
through
the
practices
of
states
Lake
2003
308
Accordingly
sovereignty
has
to
be
understood
as
nothing
exogenous
to
the
system
but
as
a
principle
of
historical
contingences
meaning
that
the
division
of
sovereignty
by
territory
internal
or
external
and
by
identity
similar
or
different
is
neither
natural
nor
necessary
but
the
result
of
several
historical
developments
Kuo
2014
79
10
In
this
regard
then
sovereignty
is
to
be
seen
as
also
fulfilling
a
function
This
has
been
illustrated
most
powerfully
by
Reus-Smit
1997
1999
2001
who
links
sovereignty
to
the
moral
purpose
of
the
state
which
is
to
be
regarded
as
the
embodiment
of
the
constitutive
values
defining
legitimate
statehood
and
rightful
action
Reus-Smit
explains
that
the
idea
of
sovereignty
did
not
emerge
in
a
moral
vacuum
but
had
to
be
justified
and
that
justification
has
always
taken
the
form
of
an
appeal
to
higher-order
values
that
define
the
identity
or
raison
d’être
of
the
state
Reus-Smit
2001
527
What
is
meant
by
this
is
that
sovereignty
has
always
been
tied
to
a
conviction
on
what
the
state’s
purpose
i.e
its
function
is
as
well
as
to
its
ability
of
fulfilling
this
purpose
Reus-Smit
1997
566
571
Accordingly
sovereignty
is
to
be
understood
as
being
contingent
on
fulfilling
its
function
that
is
guarding
the
moral
purpose
of
the
state
Obviously
what
is
associated
with
this
purpose
and
thus
what
is
considered
as
the
threshold
to
be
reached
for
an
actor
to
be
granted
legitimate
statehood
has
changed
over
time
11
However
as
evidenced
by
the
UDHR
consensus
the
moral
purpose
of
the
state
has
come
to
be
most
commonly
linked
to
the
cultivation
of
an
environment
in
which
individuals
can
freely
pursue
their
interests
protected
by
a
particular
set
of
state-sanctioned
rights
Reus-Smit
1997
571
These
rights
then
are
at
minimum
the
basic
civil
and
political
rights
agreed
upon
in
the
UDHR
and
thus
a
subset
of
the
account
of
human
rights
on
which
there
is
an
overlapping
consensus
in
international
society
It
follows
that
under
the
consensus
of
the
UDHR
which
resembles
the
contemporary
agreement
on
the
set
of
rights
that
constitute
the
moral
purpose
of
the
state
sovereignty
and
human
rights
are
co-dependent
as
the
latter
enables
and
legitimizes
the
former
while
the
former
enables
recognition
and
protection
of
the
latter
Identifying
and
being
aware
of
this
relationship
then
provides
the
necessary
justification
for
why
sovereignty
as
control
should
be
replaced
by
sovereignty
as
responsibility
This
is
the
case
because
framing
sovereignty
in
this
way
acknowledges
political
reality
which
means
that
it
is
sensitive
towards
the
fact
that
there
is
a
consensus
on
the
moral
purpose
of
the
state
i.e
the
gateway
for
sovereignty
being
the
guardian
of
human
rights
The
sovereignty
that
is
granted
to
a
state
by
international
society
under
the
current
consensus
thus
can
be
regarded
as
being
dependent
on
this
state
fulfilling
its
responsibility
towards
its
citizens
Failure
in
this
regard
will
certainly
result
in
this
state
being
publicly
condemned
and
its
sovereignty
being
partially
or
fully
revoked
due
to
it
losing
its
legitimacy
Examples
for
this
include
first
and
foremost
the
passage
of
resolutions
in
the
UN
i
to
publicly
denounce
the
failure
of
a
state
to
uphold
its
moral
purpose
e.g
UNGA
Resolution
A/RES
74
246
condemning
human
rights
abuses
against
Myanmar’s
Rohingya
Muslims
ii
to
impose
sanctions
on
such
state
e.g
UNSC
Resolution
181
imposing
an
arms
embargo
on
South
Africa
in
response
to
its
Apartheid
policies
or
iii
to
authorize
military
intervention
e.g
UNSC
Resolution
1973
authorizing
the
intervention
in
Libya
Intervention
After
having
provided
a
rationale
for
why
sovereignty
should
be
framed
as
responsibility
in
the
previous
section
what
remains
to
be
done
is
to
prove
that
the
co-dependency
of
human
rights
and
sovereignty
indeed
yields
a
positive
duty
for
states
to
intervene
in
the
affairs
of
other
states
in
order
to
defend
human
rights
Human
rights
such
as
the
right
to
life
and
freedom
from
violence
and
injury
are
what
is
called
Hohfeldian
claim
rights
that
is
duties
that
are
owed
to
other
individuals
Hohfeld
1917
In
this
sense
as
Valentini
points
out
they
follow
a
particular
logical
structure
For
an
agent
A
to
have
a
right
to
X
against
another
agent
B
is
for
A
to
have
the
standing
or
authority
to
demand
X
from
B
Feinberg
1970
Valentini
2016
53
It
follows
that
the
notion
of
a
right
is
to
be
understood
as
combining
a
duty
a
moral
ought
with
a
structure
of
interpersonal
accountability
for
the
duty’s
fulfilment
Valentini
2016
53
The
political
reality
of
this
structure
was
revealed
by
the
constructivist
perspective
which
has
shown
that
sovereignty
is
granted
by
the
state
discharging
its
duty
to
provide
protection
of
human
rights
which
has
become
regarded
as
fulfilling
its
moral
purpose
Here
the
structure
of
interpersonal
accountability
for
the
duty’s
performance
is
given
by
the
relationship
between
sovereignty
and
human
rights
where
the
latter
enables
and
legitimizes
the
former
while
the
former
enables
recognition
and
protection
of
the
latter
Thus
individuals
have
a
standing
or
authority
to
demand
X
from
B
where
B
is
the
state
However
what
remains
unclear
is
how
this
would
create
a
positive
duty
on
the
side
of
other
states
to
intervene
when
B
fails
to
discharge
its
duty
In
order
to
shed
some
light
on
this
recall
the
fact
that
the
overlapping
consensus
on
the
moral
purpose
of
the
state
that
is
illustrated
by
the
UDHR
and
the
acceptance
of
the
R
2
P
doctrine’s
idea
to
replace
sovereignty
as
control
with
sovereignty
as
responsibility
is
used
as
a
means
to
determine
which
states
can
justify
their
sovereignty
and
thus
their
legitimacy
to
international
society
by
fulfilling
their
function
of
protecting
individuals
rights
Beyond
that
as
was
shown
in
the
previous
section
what
this
consensus
constitutes
is
that
these
rights
are
regarded
to
be
universally
agreed
upon
even
though
the
underlying
comprehensive
doctrines
differ
what
in
turn
establishes
them
as
what
is
called
a
norm
on
the
constructivist
perspective
i.e
a
shared
understanding
as
to
the
permissible
limits
of
state
action
and
an
acceptance
that
conduct
should
be
justified
and
appraised
in
terms
of
that
norm
Wheeler
2002
30
The
norm
of
human
rights
protection
understood
as
the
moral
purpose
of
the
state
is
thus
to
be
seen
as
one
of
the
ordering
principles
of
international
society
a
shared
understanding
which
binds
together
it
members
meaning
that
it
is
universal
in
scope
with
respect
to
the
actors
of
international
society
Then
if
these
rights
are
universal
in
scope
and
universally
accepted
as
an
international
norm
they
constitute
a
claim
that
is
held
against
every
agent
and/or
agency
that
is
part
of
international
society
It
follows
that
in
so
far
as
these
human
rights
are
universal
they
will
have
primary
and
secondary
addressees
in
the
sense
that
they
yield
a
special
positive
perfect
duty
12
in
the
domestic
environment
of
the
state
and
a
general
imperfect
duty
13
in
international
society
What
is
meant
by
this
is
that
their
claim
against
is
directed
at
a
particular
agent
the
state
in
the
domestic
environment
whereas
such
claim
does
not
have
a
particular
addressee
in
international
society
that
could
be
held
accountable
To
illustrate
this
further
consider
the
addressees
of
the
right
to
freedom
from
torture
Based
on
the
moral
purpose
of
the
state
each
government
has
the
duty
to
safeguard
people
within
its
borders
from
torture
and
to
take
the
necessary
steps
to
prevent
deter
and
stop
torturing
Nickel
1993

The
states
sovereignty
being
contingent
on
its
ability
to
discharge
such
duty
then
highlights
why
it
cannot
refrain
from
doing
so
and
why
human
rights
protection
constitutes
a
special
positive
perfect
duty
in
the
domestic
nexus
for
which
the
state
can
be
held
accountable
by
its
citizens
However
such
an
explicit
structure
of
interpersonal
accountability
for
the
duty’s
performance
cannot
be
found
in
international
society
as
citizens
of
some
state
A
do
not
have
a
claim
against
any
particular
agent
i
of
international
society
S
in
so
far
that
they
have
not
opted
into
a
constitutional
structure
with
i
However
the
fact
that
human
rights
protection
thus
constitutes
a
general
and
imperfect
duty
with
respect
to
international
society
does
not
revoke
its
validity
Being
a
shared
understanding
which
binds
together
international
society
the
norm
still
acknowledges
that
human
rights
are
to
be
protected
This
means
that
it
does
not
deny
that
someone
ought
to
act
but
expounds
that
there
simply
is
no
identifiable
agent
who
can
be
called
upon
to
act
Tan
2006
102
What
is
important
is
that
the
issue
of
agency
here
is
thus
not
conceptual
but
strategic
Hence
even
if
it
is
not
directed
at
any
agent
in
particular
the
duty
of
human
rights
protection
still
demands
full
coverage
As
Shue
explains
universal
rights
then
entail
not
universal
duties
but
full
coverage
Shue
1988
690
This
means
that
even
though
human
rights
being
understood
as
universal
under
the
UDHR
consensus
do
not
compel
everyone
in
the
same
way
to
act
to
aid
their
protection
as
they
compel
everyone
not
to
violate
them
it
is
still
the
case
that
they
compel
action
in
general
This
means
that
all
international
actors
do
have
an
obligation
to
cooperate
and
coordinate
so
that
the
duty
of
human
rights
protection
canbe
effectively
discharged
In
this
sense
that
is
contributing
towards
the
protection
of
human
rights
intervention
in
the
affairs
of
other
states
is
a
positive
duty
that
falls
on
every
state
of
international
society
respectively
Full
coverage
then
is
to
be
provided
by
a
division
of
labour
amongst
duty-bearers
Shue
1988
690
Here
there
are
a
number
of
actions
that
outside
actors
can
undertake
to
comply
with
this
default
duty
They
might
publicly
condemn
the
human
rights
violations
apply
diplomatic
pressure
or
impose
sanctions
both
military
and
economic
However
in
situations
in
which
the
last
resort
condition
for
military
intervention
is
met
by
the
seriousness
and
urgency
of
the
human
rights
violations
that
are
taking
place
e.g
one
of
the
four
crimes
outlined
in
R
2
P
adopted
by
the
UN
it
seems
reasonable
to
suggest
that
states
would
be
morally
obliged
to
effectively
discharging
their
duty
to
protect
by
contributing
to
such
intervention
e.g
by
providing
needed
equipment
infrastructure
or
troops
Glanville
2014
52
Nevertheless
it
needs
to
be
mentioned
that
active
participation
in
a
military
intervention
is
only
a
moral
obligation
so
long
as
it
does
not
bear
excessive
cost
to
oneself
What
is
meant
by
this
is
that
it
cannot
be
expected
that
states
engage
in
intervention
if
such
intervention
would
severely
endanger
their
capacity
to
protect
the
rights
of
their
own
citizens
However
this
does
not
undermine
the
positive
duty
of
intervention
as
such
but
rather
obliges
international
society
to
distribute
the
costs
more
evenly
so
that
the
universal
protection
of
human
rights
may
still
be
discharged
Glanville
2014
56
57
Finally
as
mentioned
in
the
introduction
there
are
also
practical
reasons
for
why
states
can
have
an
interest
in
discharging
their
positive
duty
of
protecting
human
rights
beyond
their
own
borders
This
again
is
linked
to
the
political
reality
acknowledged
by
adopting
a
constructivist
perspective
As
Raymond
Cohen
has
explained
j]ust
as
the
relationship
of
the
individual
to
society
is
defined
by
a
network
of
norms
and
values
the
relationship
of
the
state
to
other
actors
in
the
international
system
can
be
thought
of
as
being
governed
by
a
network
of
permissions
and
constraints
Cohen
1980
129
State
identity
thus
is
shaped
by
the
mutual
constitution
of
agential
and
structural
interaction
in
international
society
by
which
the
shared
understandings
as
to
the
permissible
limits
of
state
action
i.e
the
norms
are
created
In
this
regard
then
international
society
is
characterised
by
compliance
and
not
by
enforcement
which
means
that
infringing
upon
the
rules
seldomly
leads
to
direct
punishment
but
that
sustained
deviation
from
the
standards
on
which
there
is
consensus
in
international
society
may
severely
damage
the
reputation
of
a
given
political
actor
Malcom
2009

37
Hence
factors
such
as
fearing
infamy
or
desiring
acceptance
can
be
as
potent
as
prevalence
of
economic
or
military
influence
in
terms
of
their
ability
to
incentivise
compliant
behaviour
It
follows
that
discharging
the
positive
duty
of
human
rights
protection
abroad
might
just
be
a
matter
of
a
state’s
interest
in
enhancing
its
status
in
international
society
14
or
making
sure
that
it
is
not
eroded
because
other
actors
deem
inaction
in
the
face
of
human
rights
violations
as
unacceptable
Yet
there
is
a
second
practical
reason
that
should
be
mentioned
This
reason
is
related
to
the
fact
that
not
acting
in
the
face
of
gross
human
rights
violations
erodes
the
authority
of
the
UN
as
the
primary
facilitator
of
international
legitimacy
The
UN
having
institutionalized
the
overlapping
consensus
on
human
rights
the
UDHR
the
fact
that
human
rights
and
sovereignty
are
co-dependent
R
2
P
and
the
threshold
for
legitimate
intervention
R
2
P
is
to
be
regarded
as
bearing
the
duty
to
oversee
international
society’s
most
extensive
moral
commitments
Then
if
it
would
fail
to
secure
that
these
commitments
are
upheld
there
is
a
risk
that
states
would
start
to
attempt
addressing
this
moral
deficit
by
looking
elsewhere
or
acting
unilaterally
Gallagher
2013
89
90
The
threat
that
arises
from
this
is
not
that
unilateral
action
may
not
be
able
to
prevent
the
human
rights
violations
that
are
taking
place
but
that
the
UN’s
authority
may
become
damaged
to
the
extent
at
which
international
instability
will
emerge
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
the
understanding
of
what
constitutes
rightful
conduct
and
rightful
authority
with
regard
to
the
use
of
force
previously
defined
and
monitored
by
the
UN
has
become
open
to
interpretation
This
would
naturally
lead
to
a
heightened
sense
of
insecurity
in
international
society
It
follows
that
a
state’s
move
on
discharging
its
positive
duty
of
human
rights
protection
abroad
can
also
be
linked
to
this
state
wanting
to
guarantee
that
international
order
continues
to
be
upheld
and
thus
to
its
own
security
concerns
Conclusion
According
to
the
above
we
can
assert
that
the
essay
has
successfully
shown
i
why
it
makes
sense
to
replace
the
notion
of
sovereignty
as
control
with
sovereignty
as
responsibility
and
ii
why
intervention
becomes
a
duty
that
falls
on
international
society
once
we
acknowledge
the
political
reality
of
i
This
was
done
by
adopting
a
constructivist
conception
of
human
rights
which
ultimately
has
yielded
a
picture
of
human
rights
and
sovereignty
being
co-dependent
In
doing
so
the
essay
was
able
to
close
a
gap
in
the
reasoning
of
the
Responsibility
to
Protect
doctrine
and
further
demonstrate
why
states
should
intervene
in
the
affairs
of
other
states
in
order
to
defend
human
rights
It
was
further
illustrated
why
discharging
the
duty
to
protect
can
also
happen
for
practical
instead
of
moral
reasons
whereby
two
examples
for
such
practical
reasons
were
presented
i
status
enhancement
and
ii
prevention
of
international
insecurity

The
International
Commission
on
Intervention
and
State
Sovereignty
was
a
commission
established
by
the
Canadian
government
to
answer
Kofi
Annan’s
question
on
how
the
international
community
should
respond
to
gross
and
systematic
violations
of
human
rights
if
humanitarian
intervention
is
indeed
an
unacceptable
assault
on
sovereignty

However
there
were
some
notable
differences
between
the
ICISS

and
the
way

was
adopted
by

Here
the
most
notable
differences
are
i
that
R
2
P
adopted
by
the
UN
only
applies
to
mass
atrocity
crimes
genocide
war
crimes
crimes
against

and
ethnic
cleansing
rather
than
human
rights
violations
in
general
ii
that
there
was
no
mention
of
the
criteria
of
intervention
and
iii
that
the
UN
Security
Council
was

as
the
only

A
positive
duty
is
a
duty
that
obliges
its
bearer
to
actively
perform
actions
or
pursue
goals
such
as
the
police’s
duty
to
protect
citizens
Accordingly
such
duties
differ
from
negative
duties
which
only
prohibit
actions
such
as
the
duty
to
refrain
from
torture

For
realists
the
survival
of
the
state
is
closely
tied
to
the
idea
of
sovereignty
meaning
that
any
limits
on
sovereignty
imposed
on
the
state
by
outside
actors
e.g
in
the
form
of
human
rights
obligations
are
seen
by
realist
as
potentially
threatening
the
state’s
security
as
they
offer
an
entry
point
that
could
be
used
by
opponents
to
intervene
in
the
state’s
affairs
5
The
point
also
has
been
raised
forcefully
by
Carl
Schmitt
When
a
state
fights
its
political
enemy
in
the
name
of
humanity
it
is
not
a
war
for
the
sake
of
humanity
but
a
war
wherein
a
particular
state
seeks
to
usurp
a
universal
concept
against
its
military
opponent
At
the
expense
of
its
opponent
it
tries
to
identify
itself
with
humanity
in
the
same
way
as
one
can
misuse
peace
justice
progress
and
civilization
in
order
to
claim
these
as
one’s
own
and
to
deny
the
same
to
the
enemy
The
concept
of
humanity
is
an
especially
useful
ideological
instrument
of
imperialist
expansion
and
in
its
ethical
humanitarian
form
it
is
a
specific
vehicle
of
economic
imperialism
Here
one
is
reminded
of
a
somewhat
modified
expression
of
Proudhon’s
whoever
invokes
humanity
wants
to
cheat
Schmitt
1932
54

Examples
for
this
include
among
others
the
European
Convention
on
Human
Rights
the
American
Convention
on
Human
Rights
and
the
African
Charter
the
Banjul
Charter
on
Human
and
Peoples
Rights
as
they
all
have
yielded
the
establishment
of
judicial
or
quasi-judicial
bodies
which
deal
with
violations
of
the
human
rights
they
specify
committed
by
states
7
Following
from
this
while
realists
tend
to
look
to
Hobbes
and
Machiavelli
in
order
to
justify
the
promotion
of
national
self-interest
liberals
draw
heavily
on
the
works
of
Locke
and
Kant
In
this
respect
especially
Kant’s
Perpetual
Peace
1795
has
been
a
lodestar
for
the
theory
as
it
develops
an
idea
of
international
liberalism
emphasizing
that
all
individuals
have
equal
moral
worth
which
is
why
an
abuse
of
rights
in
one
part
of
the
world
is
felt
everywhere
Dunne
and
Hanson
2016

Something
similar
can
be
observed
today
at
Europe’s
borders
as
we
watch
refugees
get
rejected
and
deported
back
to
Turkey
under
an
EU-sponsored
migration
deal

The
same
point
has
been
raised
by
Ruggie
1993
and
Philpott
2001
11
For
example
in
ancient
Greece
the
moral
purpose
of
the
state
was
seen
in
the
cultivation
of
bios
politikos
which
is
a
distinctive
form
of
communal
life
Renaissance
Italians
linked
it
to
the
terms
of
the
pursuit
of
civic
glory
in
Europe
during
the
age
of
absolutism
it
was
tied
it
to
the
preservation
of
a
divinely
ordained
rigidly
hierarchical
social
order
and
since
the
Enlightenment
the
moral
purpose
of
the
state
has
been
understood
as
the
protection
of
individuals
rights

Special
duties
are
owed
to
a
specific
set
of
persons
whereas
general
duties
are
owed
to
all
persons
simply
qua
persons
In
this
regard
special
duties
are
usually
understood
as
duties
we
have
to
those
peoples
we
stand
in
some
sort
of
special
relationship
to
e.g
friends
family
members
colleagues
fellow
citizens
and
those
to
whom
we
have
made
promises
or
commitments
of
some
sort
Jeske
2019
13
In
the
case
of
perfect
duties
there
is
no
latitude
for
discretion
in
when
how
where
and
toward
whom
the
duty
should
be
performed
Breakey
2015
1200
Imperfect
duties
however
usually
do
not
specify
when
how
where
and
toward
whom
the
duty
should
be
performed

Titanic

Transnational

In
April
1998
Titanic
garnered
the
accolade
of
becoming
China’s
all-time
blockbuster
by
shattering
former
box-office
records
The
Titanic
miracle
as
the
film’s
unprecedented
commercial
success
was
dubbed
in
the
Chinese
media
provides
copious
material
with
which
to
explore
numerous
issues
at
stake
in
China’s
contemporary
culture
industry
including
questions
concerning
the
globalization
and
commercialization
of
the
culture
industry
within
the
context
of
China’s
domestic
market
reforms
and
official
Party
ideology
How
is
China
participating
in
and
recreating
global
culture
How
are
China’s
expanding
market
reforms
affecting
the
production
and
consumption
of
culture
What
is
the
role
of
the
Party’s
official
ideology
in
relation
to
the
commercialization
and
globalization
of
culture
How
are
alliances
being
constructed
along
the
axis
of
capital
across
national
borders
Exploration
of
these
questions
is
based
on
research
conducted
in
China
centered
on
investigating
the
commercial
practices
and
discursive
rhetoric
which
propelled
and
shaped
the
Titanic
miracle
It
appears
that
the
film
industry
in
China
is
predominately
governed
by
a
commercial
logic
dictated
by
profit
maximization
as
adopted
by
both
official
cultural
policies
and
commercial
practices
As
played
out
by
the
Titanic
miracle
we
observe
how
culture
remains
an
ideological
tool
for
the
Party
whose
central
maxim
appears
to
be
commercial
enterprise
and
economic
growth
Whereas
cultural
artifacts
during
the
Maoist
era
as
dictated
by
the
Party
ideologically
opposed
capitalism
today’s
culture
industry
embraces
the
market
and
what
sells
in
accordance
with
official
cultural
policy
In
the
case
of
the
film
industry
Hollywood
films
are
eagerly
adopted
to
fulfill
the
commercial
and
official
objective
of
making
money
In
the
end
as
the
Titanic
miracle
illustrates
China’s
film
industry
is
marked
by
an
unexpected
collusion
between
Hollywood
movie-moguls
and
high-ranking
Leninist
officials
whose
ideological
differences
and
national
loyalties
are
negotiated
by
their
homage
to
the
accumulation
of
capital

About
the
Author
It
is
widely
assumed
that
admission
to
elite
U.S
universities
is
based
solely
on
academic
merit—the
best
and
brightest
are
admitted
to
Harvard
Yale
and
their
peer
institutions
as
determined
by
test
scores
and
GPA
and
not
by
lineage
or
family
income
But
does
reality
support
those
expectations
Or
are
admissions
governed
by
a
logic
that
rewards
socioeconomic
status
while
disguising
it
as
personal
merit
The
Power
of
Privilege
examines
the
nexus
between
social
class
and
admissions
at
America's
top
colleges
from
the
vantage
point
of
Yale
University
a
key
actor
in
the
history
of
higher
education
It
is
a
documented
history
of
the
institutional
gatekeepers
confident
of
the
validity
of
socially
biased
measures
of
merit
seeking
to
select
tomorrow's
leadership
class
from
among
their
economically
privileged
clientele
Acceptance
in
prestigious
colleges
still
remains
beyond
the
reach
of
most
students
except
those
from
high-income
professional
families
Ultimately
the
author
suggests
reforms
that
would
move
America's
top
schools
toward
becoming
genuine
academic
meritocracies
This
close
examination
of
admissions
always
carefully
contextualized
in
the
broad
historical
trends
in
elite
higher
education
of
which
they
were
a
part
just
a
few
of
the
connections
that
the
book
fruitfully
explores
are
anti-Semitism
forays
into
eugenics
the
rise
of
standardized
tests
and
the
quantification
of
character
draws
our
focus
to
the
hidden
mechanisms
by
which
reproduction
is
effected
This
is
important
work
and
will
likely
be
the
book's
most
lasting
contribution
This
well-written
and
often
fascinating
book
exhorts
readers
to
look
vigilantly
behind
the
rhetoric
of
meritocracy
and
to
pay
closer
attention
to
the
real
effects
of

An
excellent
sociological
account
of
a
highly
selective
institutional
gatekeeper
Yale
University
Soares's
history
of
Yale
admissions
is
tragically
amusing
He
chronicles
an
embarrassing
past
that
includes
Yale's
enthusiasm
for
the
early
SAT
as
a
tool
of
eugenics
and
the
college's
participation
until
1968
in
the
Ivy
League
practice
of
taking
nude
pictures
of
freshmen
men
to
study
the
relationship
between
body
type
and
ability
Chronicle
of
Higher
Education
Soares
presents
compelling
evidence
that
the
Scholastic
Assessment
Test
SAT
later
renamed
the
Scholastic
Achievement
Test
not
only
opened
ivy-covered
doors
to
a
more
academically
talented
and
diverse
student
body
but
also
assured
the
continued
selection
of
students
from
the
highest
economic
stratum
He
provides
an
interesting
social
history
of
admissions
at
one
institution
and
a
window
into
a
world
that
if
Soares
is
correct
most
readers
likely
were
never
intended
or
permitted
to
set
foot
Review
of
Higher
Education
Even
Americans
unfamiliar
with
the
word
embrace
meritocracy
as
if
it
were
a
birthright
writes
Soares
who
taught
sociology
at
Yale
and
uses
the
university
as
a
test
case
for
a
stinging
indictment
of
how
far
Yale
and
similar
colleges
fall
short
of
the
meritocratic
ideal
He
also
offers
provocative
suggestions
for

Soares
has
become
something
of
an
expert
on
the
social
transformations
of
universities
His
first
book
also
from
Stanford
was
The
Decline
of
Privilege
The
Modernization
of
Oxford
University
which
traced
the
way
Oxford
evolved
from
its
Brideshead
Revisited
image
to
an
institution
that
had
meritocratic
values
In
an
interview
Soares
said
he
wanted
to
do
an
American
companion
and
started
off
assuming
he
would
find
the
same
sort
of
evolution
in
the
United
States
But
with
a
focus
at
Yale
that's
not
what
he
found
Given
that
Yale
has
described
itself
repeatedly
as
having
gone
through
such
an
evolution
this
was
surprising
to
Soares
and
he
argues
that
the
differences
between
myth
and
reality
point
to
important
steps
for
a
number
of
colleges
to
consider
today

Distinguishing
between
factors

to

draws
nuanced

The
Power
of
Privilege
is
a
welcome
addition
to
the
literature
on
elite
colleges
educational
stratification
and
the
meritocratic
myth
in
college
admissions
This
is
a
story
not
just
of
SAT
scores
but
also
of
admissions
processes
that
favor
legacies
athletes
and
nebulous
qualities
of
leadership
and
character
in
which
the
interests
of
the
wealthy
and
professional
classes
in
securing
advantages
for
their

indeed
are
well
served

advances
some
interesting

The
Power
of

shows
to
anyone
without
experience
in
college

the
ambiguity
of
constructing
admissions
policies
and
converting
how
someone
is
presented
on
paper
into
a
judgment
of
that
individual's
potential
for
future
success
One
of
the
book's
strengths
is
Soares
engaging
writing
style
which
captures
the
complexity
of
the
issue
but
is
nonetheless
highly
readable
This
broadens
its
appeal
beyond

in
the
field
to
an
audience
perhaps
less
familiar
with
the
scholarly
body
of

pertaining

prevails
over

Abstract
Science
maps
are
visual
representations
of
the
structure
and
dynamics
of
scholarly
knowledge
They
aim
to
show
how
fields
disciplines
journals
scientists
publications
and
scientific
terms
relate
to
each
other
Science
mapping
is
the
body
of
methods
and
techniques
that
have
been
developed
for
generating
science
maps
This
entry
is
an
introduction
to
science
maps
and
science
mapping
It
focuses
on
the
conceptual
theoretical
and
methodological
issues
of
science
mapping
rather
than
on
the
mathematical
formulation
of
science
mapping
techniques
After
a
brief
history
of
science
mapping
we
describe
the
general
procedure
for
building
a
science
map
presenting
the
data
sources
and
the
methods
to
select
clean
and
pre-process
the
data
Next
we
examine
in
detail
how
the
most
common
types
of
science
maps
namely
the
citation-based
and
the
term-based
are
generated
Both
are
based
on
networks
the
former
on
the
network
of
publications
connected
by
citations
the
latter
on
the
network
of
terms
co-occurring
in
publications
We
review
the
rationale
behind
these
mapping
approaches
as
well
as
the
techniques
and
methods
to
build
the
maps
from
the
extraction
of
the
network
to
the
visualization
and
enrichment
of
the
map
We
also
present
less-common
types
of
science
maps
including
co-authorship
networks
interlocking
editorship
networks
maps
based
on
patents
data
and
geographic
maps
of
science
Moreover
we
consider
how
time
can
be
represented
in
science
maps
to
investigate
the
dynamics
of
science
We
also
discuss
some
epistemological
and
sociological
topics
that
can
help
in
the
interpretation
contextualization
and
assessment
of
science
maps
Then
we
present
some
possible
applications
of
science
maps
in
science
policy
In
the
conclusion
we
point
out
why
science
mapping
may
be
interesting
for
all
the
branches
of
meta-science
from
knowledge
organization
to
epistemology

Introduction
Science
maps
also

maps
are

Science
mapping
is
the
body
of
methods
and
techniques
that
have
been
developed
to
generate
science
maps
Science
mapping
has
a
long
tradition
in
bibliometrics
and
scientometrics
i.e
the
quantitative
studies
of
science

In
the
last
decades
it
has
increasingly
become
an
interdisciplinary
area
witnessing
important
contributions
from
data
science
where
science
mapping
belongs
to
the
larger
and
increasingly
important
area
of
information
visualization
Börner
Chen
and
Boyack
2005
Science
maps
have
several
applications
They
help
to
answer
questions
such
as
What
are
the
main
topics
within
a
certain
scientific
domain
How
do
these
topics
relate
to
each
other
How
has
a
certain
scientific
domain
developed
over
time
Who
are
the
key
actors
researchers
institutions
journals
of
a
scientific
field
Science
maps
help
to
investigate
how
the
structural
units
of
science
relate
one
another
at
the
micro
and
macro
level
Leydesdorff
1987
what
factors
determine
the
emergence
of
new
scientific
fields
and
the
development
of
interdisciplinary
areas
Leydesdorff
and
Goldstone
2014
and
more
generally
how
scientific
change
functions
Leydesdorff
2001
Lucio-Arias
and
Leydesdorff
2009
At
the
same
time
the
information
made
accessible
by
science
maps
can
be
highly
relevant
for
science
policy
purposes
Science
maps
and
especially
the
global
maps
also
known
as
atlases
of
science
see
Section
3
2
Field
delineation
can
help
to
classify
the
sciences
by
showing
their
mutual
relationships
e.g
by
showing
the
citation
flows
between
fields
In
this
sense
science
maps
are
useful
tools
in
knowledge
organization
and
have
been
used
to
build
classification
systems
with
a
bottom-up
approach
see
e.g
Waltman
and
van
Eck
2012
However
standard
methods
of
science
mapping
are
not
based
on
and
do
not
result
in
semantic
relationships
between
categories
e.g
genus-species
relation
but
association
measures
between
units
of
analysis
e.g
co-citation
strength
between
publications
or
co-authorship
association
between
authors
The
closest
to
semantic
relations
that
can
be
produced
by
standard
science
mapping
approaches
is
the
relation
of
inclusion
obtained
by
clustering
techniques
in
which
higher-order
clusters
include
lower-order
clusters
see

Rather
they
can
integrate
them
by
providing
extra
information
on
the
structure
of
science
based
on
the
analysis
of
citation
networks
and
other
kinds
of
scientific
networks
At
the
same
time
the
application
of
science
maps
is
not
restricted
to
knowledge
organization
but
extends
to
the
sociology
of
science
and

Structure
of
the
entry
This
article
is
an
introduction
to
science
maps
and
science
mapping
methodology
It
is
structured
as
follows
Section
2
offers
a
brief
overview
of
the
history
of
science
mapping
Section
3
presents
the
standard
workflow
behind
a
science
map
and
the
preliminary
steps
of
science
mapping
data
collection
field
delineation
data
pre-processing
and
network
extraction
Section
4
examines
the
different
types
of
science
maps
that
can
be
generated
from
network
data
Section
4
1
is
devoted
to
citation-based
maps
i.e
those
maps
that
are
based
on
publications
or
aggregates
of
publications
and
citations
or
citation-based
relations
between
publications
This
section
describes
in
details
some
procedures
that
are
common
also
to
other
science
maps
such
as
the
normalization
of
the
raw
relatedness
scores
and
the
two
most
diffused
visualization
approaches
the
graph-based
and
the
distance-based
It
also
presents
some
techniques
that
can
be
used
to
complement
the
results
of
mapping
and
ease
the
interpretation
of
science
maps
such
as
clustering
Section
4
2
discusses
term-based
maps
i.e
those
maps
that
are
based
on
the
analysis
of
the
titles
abstracts
keywords
or
bibliographic
descriptors
of
scientific
publications
We
will
first
present
the
classic
co-word
analysis
as
developed
in
the
sociology
of
science
and
then
focus
on
maps
based
on
terms
extracted
automatically
with
natural
language
processing
techniques
Section
4
3
briefly
overviews
science
maps
based
on
co-authorship
and
interlocking
editorship
networks
whereas
Section
4
4
reviews
science
maps
based
on
patents
and
geographic
maps
of
science
Section
5
discusses
different
strategies
to
include
the
dimension
of
time
into
science
maps
Section
6
is
devoted
to
the
last
step
in
the
science
mapping
workflow
namely
interpretation
and
to
discuss
some
general
issues
of
science
mapping
such
as
the
importance
of
the
level
of
analysis
and
the
applicability
of
science
mapping
to
the
humanities
In
Section
7
some
epistemological
topics
which
bridge
across
science
mapping
sociology
of
science
and
philosophy
of
science
are
discussed
the
objectivity
of
science
maps
the
relationship
between
the
published
side
of
science
and
the
scientific
practice
and
the
meaning
of
citations
Section
8
overviews
the
potential
applications
of
science
maps
in
science
policy
Lastly
the
Conclusion
will
sketch
how
science
mapping
may
be
of
interest
for
all
the
disciplines
that
compose
meta-science
In
the

conceptual
theoretical
and
methodological
issues
of
science
mapping
rather
than
on
the
rigorous
mathematical
formulation
of
science
mapping
techniques
as
the
basic
ideas
behind
the
techniques
can
often
be
understood
without
reference
to
the
formal
machinery
Relevant
technical
literature
will
be
pointed
out
in
the
references
Secondly
we
will
focus
on
the
methodology
of
science
mapping
rather
than
on
specific
exemplars
of
science
maps
We
aim
to
provide
the
readers
with
the
tools
to
understand
and
independently
assess
the
science
maps
they
will
encounter
or
produce
rather
than
offer
our
opinion
on
existing
maps
A
wonderful
collection
of
science
maps
can
be
found
in
the
Atlas
of
Science
by
Katy
Börner
Börner

and
in
the

which
popularizes
the
topic
of
science

to
the
large
public
all
over
the
world
since
2005

Lastly
science
mapping
is
not
a
static
research
field
but
it
is
constantly
moving
forward
New
mapping
methods
are
developed
old
algorithms
are
dismissed
science
mapping
tools
are
refined
larger
maps
are
built
as
higher
computing
capacity
becomes
available
Therefore
it
is
not
uncommon
to
find
disagreement
in
the
current
science
maps
literature
e.g
Boyack
and
Klavans
2010
In
this
article
we
will
try
as
far
as
possible
to
remain
neutral
concerning
these
discussions
presenting
to
the
reader
the
different
options

A
brief
history
of
science
mapping
Modern
science
mapping
relies
on
the
data
provided
by
large
multidisciplinary
databases
that
index
vast
portions
of
the
scientific
literature
see
Section
3
1
Data
sources
for
science
mapping
Before
the
creation
of
these
databases
in
the
1960
s
it
was
virtually
impossible
to
generate
science
maps
in
the
modern
sense
The
idea
of
representing
the
structure
of
human
knowledge
by
visual
aids
however
dates
far
back
in
history

Ancestors
of
science
maps
Already
in
the
Middle
Age
the
relationships
between
the
seven
liberal
arts
comprising
the
trivium
and
quadrivium
were
visually
represented
by
allegories
2
However
the
most
popular
visual
metaphor
in
history
for
visualizing
knowledge
has
been
the
tree
Lima
2014
Its
origins
can
be
traced
back
to
Aristotle
and
to
the
Isagoge
an
introduction
to
Aristotle’s
logic
written
by
Porphyry
in
the
3
rd
Century
In
the
13
th
Century
Ramon
Llull
depicted
a
tree
of
the
sciences
in
his
Arbor
Scientiae
1295
Descartes
in
the
Principia
Philosophiae
1644
used
the
same
image
to
explain
the
relationship
between
metaphysics
physics
and
the
applied
sciences
During
the
Enlightenment
the
famous
Encyclopédie
of
Diderot
and
d’Alambert
contained
a
tree-like
taxonomy
of
human
knowledge
Système
figuré
des
connaissances
humaines
Similar
structures
can
be
found
also
in
the
19
th
Century
in
philosophical
treaties
on
the
classification
and
organization
of
the
sciences

Modern
science
mapping
The
tree-like
representations
of
the
sciences
in
the
past
had
usually
a
philosophical
aim
They
served
to
reflect
on
the
most
general
principles
that
underlie
human
knowledge
At
the
same
time
they
aimed
at
organizing
scientific
and
scholarly
disciplines
by
creating
hierarchies
between
them
Often
they
were
proposed
with
a
normative
spirit
more
than
describing
the
actual
organization
of
knowledge
they
wanted
to
reform
and
improve
it
What
they
all
shared
was
a
top-down
approach
Starting
from
a
certain
idea
of
human
knowledge
and
a
certain
set
of
classificatory
categories
a
taxonomy
was
devised
which
was
then
used
to
categorize
the
individual
items
of
knowledge
such
as
books
or
scientific
papers
The
Dewey
Decimal
Classification
a
library
classification
system
developed
in
1876
epitomizes
such
a
top-down
approach
The
creation
of
the
Science
Citation
Index
SCI
in
the
1960
s
by
Eugene
Garfield
at
the
Institute
for
Scientific
Information
allowed
for
a
first
time
a
bottom-up
approach
As
we
will
see
better
in
the
next
sections
see
Section

Network
extraction
the
SCI
indexed
the
citation-links
between
the
articles
published
in
scientific
journals
In
this
way
it
allowed
to
reconstruct
the
network
in
which
each
scientific
article
is
embedded
and
by
connecting
all
these
networks
to
reconstruct
the
structure
of
entire
scientific
areas
In
this
way
a
new
method
to
map
human
knowledge
became
possible
The
historian
of
science
Derek
De
Solla
Price
was
the
first
to
suggest
such
an
idea
in
1965
Price
1965
Garfield
himself
proposed
the
method
of
historiographs
to
reconstruct
the
temporal
development
of
scientific
ideas
by
analyzing
the
citation
links
between
publications

The
representation
of
time
in
science
mapping
In
the
1960
s
and
1970
s
two
new
techniques
both
based
on
citations
were
developed
to
measure
the
association
of
scientific
papers
bibliographic
coupling
Kessler
1963
and
co-citation
Small
1973
Marshakova
1973
They
soon
became
standard
techniques
for
science
mapping

The
links
in
citation-based
maps
Henry
Small
started
to
use
co-citation
analysis
to
map
scientific
areas
and
study
their
evolution
over
time
He
generated
the
first
science
maps
based
on
co-citation
analysis
in
1977
to
study
the
field
of
collagen
research
Small
1977
In
the
1980
s
new
methods
of
analysis
were
developed
such
as
author
co-citation
analysis
White
and
Griffith
1981
and
co-word
analysis
Callon
et
al
1983
At
the
same
time
the
technical
aspects
of
science
mapping
were
discussed
and
sometimes
disputed
Leydesdorff
1987
The
1990
s
saw
important
advancements
in
computer
visualization
techniques
and
in
1991
the
first
science
mapping
program
for
the
personal
computer
SCI-map
was
made
available
In
the
2000
s
the
improvement
of
computer
capacity
allowed
to
produce
the
first
global
maps
of
science
based
on
the
analysis
of
thousands
of
journals
and
millions
of
publications
New
user-friendly
science
mapping
tools
such
as
CiteSpace
and
VOSviewer
were
launched
in
the
2010
s
so
that
nowadays
also
the
non-experts
can
generate
their
own
science
maps
In
the
last
twenty
years
science
mapping
has
become
an
increasingly
interdisciplinary
area
with
important
contributions
from
computer
scientists
and
experts
in
information
visualization
and
the
last
ten
years
have
seen
what
has
been
called
a
Cambrian
explosion
of
science
maps

Building
a
science
map
the
general
workflow
The
construction
of
a
science
map
follows
a
general
workflow
that
comprises
the
following
steps
Börner
Chen
and
Boyack
2005
Cobo
et
al
2011
b
1
Data
collection
Based
on
the
research
question
of
the
analyst
the
data
for
the
mapping
are
collected
In
principle
any
relational
feature
of
the
scientific
activity
can
be
collected
by
different
methods
In
practice
however
most
science
mapping
studies
are
based
on
data
stored
in
bibliographic
data
sources
Hence
the
data
collection
consists
in
individuating
appropriate
queries
to
extract
bibliographic
data
from
those
sources
2
Pre-processing
The
raw
data
are
cleaned
and
if
needed
further
selected
for
instance
only
publications
cited
over
a
certain
threshold
are
retained
This
step
is
crucial
since
the
goodness
of
the
mapping
depends
on
the
quality
of
the
underlying
data
3
Network
extraction
Depending
on
the
chosen
unit
of
analysis
publication
term
author
journal
institution
etc
and
the
kind
of
analysis
direct
linkage
co-citation
bibliographic
coupling
co-word
analysis
etc
the
corresponding
network
is
extracted
from
the
data
4
Normalization
Usually
the
relatedness
scores
e.g
the
raw
number
of
co-citations
between
publications
are
not
directly
used
to
generate
the
science
maps
because
experience
and
experimentation
have
shown
that
they
can
create
distortions
due
to
the
different
sizes
of
the
items
Boyack
and
Klavans
2019
It
is
thus
a
common
practice
to
perform
normalization
on
the
raw
values
using
similarity
measures
5
Visualization
There
are
different
options
to
visualize
the
network
In
graph-based
visualizations
graph
drawing
algorithms
are
used
In
distance-based
visualizations
dimensionality
reduction
techniques
are
used
to
plot
the
data
into
a
two-dimensional
or
more
rarely
three-dimensional
layout
so
that
the
distances
between
the
points
on
the
map
reflect
the
similarity
of
the
units
of
analysis
6
Enrichment
The
elements
of
the
map
can
be
enriched
to
provide
more
information
Frequently
clustering
techniques
are
used
to
find
groups
of
similar
nodes
and
colors
are
used
to
distinguish
nodes
belonging
to
different
clusters
7
Interpretation
The
science
map
is
interpreted
usually
with
the
help
of
experts
in
the
mapped
domain
The
visual
nature
of
the
map
enables
the
recognition
of
patterns
and
structures
which
can
provide
an
answer
to
research
questions
or
help
in
addressing
science
policy
issues
In
the
next
sections
we
focus
on
the
first
three
steps
of
science
mapping
data
collection
data
pre-processing
and
network
extraction
Based
on
the
type
of
network
extracted
different
types
of
science
maps
can
be
generated
In
Section
4
each
type
is
examined
in
detail
Note
that
citation-based
maps
will
allow
us
to
describe
the
steps
of
normalization
visualization
and
enrichment
that
recur
also
in
the
generation
of
other
types
of
science
maps

Data
sources
for
science
mapping
Science
mapping
is
a
methodology
that
can
be
applied
in
principle
to
a
variety
of
data
regarding
the
scientific
enterprise
In
practice
however
the
main
data
sources
for
science
mapping
are
bibliographic
databases
Other
types
of
data
must
be
collected
by
the
analysts
Bibliographic
databases
used
to
this
purpose
are
large
multi-disciplinary
databases
that
collect
the
metadata
of
academic
publications
authors
title
abstract
keywords
affiliation
of
the
authors
publication
year
etc
along
with
their
citations
hence
their
name
of
citation
indexes
The
main
citation
indexes
are
Clarivate’s
Web
of
Science
WoS
Elseviers
Scopus
and
Google
Scholar
Recently
two
open
bibliographic
databases
have
joined

Moreover
in
2017
Crossref
a
not-for-profit
organization
of
publishers
has
made
its
citation
data
openly
available
Comparisons
between
the
coverage
of
these
new
databases
and
the
coverage
of
traditional
databases
are
currently
being
undertaken
by
the
bibliometric
community
Visser
van
Eck
and
Waltman

Harzing
2019
In
addition
to
multi-disciplinary
databases
there
are
also
specialized
databases
focusing
on
specific
disciplines
e.g
PubMed
for
medicine
and
PsycInfo
for
psychology
Patent
data
can
be
retrieved
from
specific
data
sources

Field
delineation
To
produce
a
science
map
we
first
need
to
individuate
a
set
of
publications
that
reasonably
represent
the
target
of
the
mapping
In
bibliometrics
this
step
is
often
called
field
delineation
Field
delineation
is
the
collection
of
documents
that
are
both
relevant
and
specific
for
the
purpose
of
the
mapping
Zhao
2009
At
this
point
an
important
difference
can
be
made
between
global
and
local
maps
of
science
Global
maps
of
science
also
known
as
atlases
of
science
aim
to
map
the
whole
science
Börner
et
al
2012
Boyack
Klavans
and
Börner
2005
Boyack
and
Klavans
2019
To
produce
such
maps
the
main
criteria
is
to
maximize
coverage
Local
maps
of
science
on
the
other
hand
focus
on
a
limited
portion
of
the
scientific
literature
Rafols
Porter
and
Leydesdorff
2010
Such
a
portion
can
be
a
scientific
field
a
specialty
a
research
topic
or
the
publication
output
of
a
university
In
all
these
cases
the
accurate
selection
of
the
target
publications
is
a
crucial
step
since
an
unrepresentative
or
wrong
set
of
publications
will
produce
a
misrepresentation
of
the
target
Following
Zitt
and
colleagues
we
distinguish
three
general
strategies
for
field
delineation
A
rely
on
external
formalized
resources
such
as
ready-made
science
classifications
B
create
ad
hoc
information
retrieval
searches
C
use
network
exploration
resources
i.e
science
mapping
itself
Laurens
Zitt
and
Bassecoulard
2010
Zitt
et
al
2019
Zitt
and
Bassecoulard
2006
The
first
strategy
is
based
on
ready-made
classifications
such
as
the
ones
used
by
Web
of
Science
or
Scopus
to
classify
their
records
Other
classificatory
schemes
are
produced
in
institutional
settings
e.g
by
research
evaluation
agencies
or
by
research
councils
and
clearly
by
libraries
Note
that
sometimes
the
journal
rather
than
the
individual
article
is
the
unit
of
classification
with
the
articles
inheriting
the
category
of
the
journals
where
they
are
published
Following
this
first
strategy
representative
literature
is
retrieved
by
using
these
ready-made
classifications
at
different
levels
of
granularity
scientific
field
specialty
sub-area
etc
An
evident
shortcoming
of
this
strategy
is
that
it
heavily
relies
on
the
goodness
of
the
chosen
classifications
The
second
strategy
is
based
on
creating
usually
in
close
interaction
with
domain
experts
ad
hoc
searches
to
query
the
databases
These
queries
can
potentially
include
any
searchable
part
of
the
bibliographic
records
words
in
titles
and
abstracts
keywords
authors
affiliations
journals
dates
references
and
so
on
A
typical
query
combines
a
search
for
specialized
journals
and
a
lexical
search
in
complement
Note
that
the
starting
queries
can
be
refined
for
instance
by
citation
analysis
Once
a
core
set
of
publications
journals
or
even
key
authors
is
determined
new
records
are
added
by
following
the
citations
articles
citing
the
core
set
or
the
references
articles
cited
by
the
core
set
in
an
iterative
process
The
third
strategy
relies
on
science
mapping
methods
and
in
particular
on
clustering
The
basic
idea
is
to
use
bottom-up
clustering
techniques
that
group
publications
based
not
on
a
classificatory
scheme
but
on
their
reciprocal
relations
for
instance
their
co-citation
strength
see
Section
4

The
links
in
citation-based
maps
Techniques
of
network
analysis
as
well
as
experts
knowledge
are
then
used
to
select
the
relevant
clusters
By
iterating
this
procedure
an
increasingly
precise
field
delineation
is
obtained
All
these
approaches
involve
the
double
risk
of
losing
relevant
publications
and
introducing
noise
not
relevant
publications
in
the
dataset
Zitt
et
al
2019
In
fact
there
is
no
fit-to-all
solution
to
field
delineation
From
an
operative
point
of
view
a
good
strategy
is
to
combine
recursively
the
different
approaches
checking
each
time
the
set
of
retrieved
publications
and
refining
accordingly
the
queries
an
example
of
this
approach
can
be
found
in
Chen
2017
However
it
is
important
to
remember
that
from
a
theoretical
point
of
view
there
is
no
ground
truth
basis
for
defining
research
domains
in
a
purely
objective
way
As
the
ongoing
discussion
about
research
areas
definition
and
classification
shows
research
classification
should
be
conceived
as
a
social
process
involving
multiple
actors
from
researchers
to
journals
to
research
evaluation
agencies
rather
than
as
a
static
photograph
of
the
structure
of
science
Classificatory
schemes
as
well
as
the
boundaries
between
areas
are
constantly
negotiated
and
reshaped
under
the
pressure
of
different
social
systems
and
infrastructures
Sugimoto
and
Weingart
2015
As
these
systems
serve
different
purposes
and
are
governed
by
different
logics
frictions
and
inconsistences
between
the
classificatory
schemes
they
produce
are
to
be
expected
Åström
Hammarfelt
and
Hansson
2017
For
instance
an
article
can
be
classified
as
belonging
to
research
area
X
based
on
the
institutional
affiliation
of
its
authors
and
to
research
area
Y
based
on
the
topic
of
the
journal
where
it
is
published
Even
if
field
delineation
is
the
first
step
in
many
bibliometric
analyses
including
science
mapping
its
theoretical
stakes
should
not
be
underestimated

Cleaning
the
data
is
a
pivotal
step
in
the
science
mapping
workflow
because
the
quality
of
the
results
depends
on
the
quality
of
the
data
This
task
however
can
be
highly
time-consuming
and
can
present
difficult
issues
such
as
the
disambiguation
of
authors
with
homonym
names
and
the
merging
of
authors
with
multiple
names

After
the
cleaning
the

can
be
pre-processed
They
can
be
divided
into
different

sub-periods
to
carry
out
longitudinal

Network
extraction
In
general
a
network
is
a
structure
made
of
nodes
also
called
vertices
and
links
also
called
edges
It
can
be
represented
as
a
graph
or
as
a
matrix
Networks
are
valuable
tools
to
represent
and
study
a
great
variety
of
natural
and
social
phenomena
from
the
lineage
of
a
family
to
patterns
of
contracts
among
firms
to
the
spreading
of
a
virus
Barabási
2014
In
science
mapping
we
are
interested
in
those
networks
that
can
capture
the
structure
of
science
at
different
levels
and
from
different
points
of
view
In
fact
these
networks
are
the
basic
structure
on
which
science
maps
are
built
From
the
same
set
of
bibliographic
records
it
is
possible
to
generate
different
networks
depending
on
the
type
of
nodes
and
links
we
decide
to
focus
on
The
nodes
will
represent
the
unit
of
analysis
of
the
final

the
links
will
represent

Types
of
science
maps
Science
maps
can
be
classified
into
different
types
depending
on
the
kind
of
data
and
hence
the
kind
of
network
they
are
based
on
In
principle
any
feature
of
the
scientific
enterprise
that
can
be
represented
in
relational
terms
i.e
as
a
network
of
nodes
and
links
can
be
used
to
generate
a
science
map
In
citation-based
maps
the
units
of
analysis
the
nodes
are
publications
or
aggregates
of
publications
e.g
journals
or
authors
and
the
relationships
between
them
the
links
are
citations
or
association
measures
based
on
citations
bibliographic
coupling
and
co-citation
In
term-based
maps
the
units
of
analysis
are
textual
items
themes
keywords
or
terms
and
the
relationships
are
co-occurrence
frequencies
e.g
the
number
of
times
two
keywords
are
used
together
in
a
set
of
publications
In
co-authorship
maps
the
units
are
the
authors
and
the
links
are
the
number
of
co-authored
publications
In
interlocking
editorship
maps
the
units
are
the
journals
and
the
links
are
the
number
of
persons
who
are
shared
between
the
editorial
boards
of
two
journals
In
addition
to
these
there
are
also
science
maps
based
on
patents
data
and
geographic
maps
of
science
which
will
be
the

The
nodes
in
citation-based
maps
publications
and
aggregates
of
publications
In
the
most
basic
citation-based
map
the
nodes
represent
individual
publications
and
the
links
the
citations
reference-links
among
them
An
example
of
citation
network
is
provided
in
Fig
1
where
it
is
visualized
as
a
directed
network
in
which
nodes
represent
publications
and
arrows
represent
the
reference-links
citations
between
them
Some
publications
are
both
citing
and
cited
e.g
publication
a
some
publications
are
only
cited
e.g
publication
f
and
some
publications
cite
without
being
cited
e.g
publication
e
Fig

The

matrix
whose
elements
indicate
whether
pairs
of
nodes
are
connected
adjacent
in
the
network
or
not
When

Since
publications
are
provided
with
meta-data
such
as
their
authors
or
the
journals
in
which
they
are
published
it
is
possible
to
build
aggregates
of
publications
sharing
the
same
meta-data
Radicchi
Fortunato
and
Vespignani
2012
By
aggregating
publications
at
a
higher
and
higher
level
we
can
reach
higher
units
of
the
analysis
and
networks
based
on
new
types
of
nodes
To
understand
this
mechanism
we
show
how
to
build
a
journal
citation
network
Leydesdorff
2004
McCain
1991
starting
from
the
document
citation
network
of
Fig

We
start
by
coloring
the
nodes
according
to
the
journals
where
they
are
published
and
the
citation
links
according
to
the
journal
to
which
they
point

Citation
network

based
on
the
journal
they
were
published
in
The
color
of
the
arrows
corresponds
to
the
color
of
the
citing
journal
The
journal
citation
network
is
obtained
by
substituting
each
article
with
its
journal
of
publication
and
then
using
the
journals
as
nodes
of
the
network
A
link
between
two
journals
is
drawn
when
they
exchange
at
least
one
citation
Note
that
in
this
new
network
it
is
possible
to
provide
links
with
weight
that
is
the
number
of
citations
that
each
journal
receives
from
other
journals
or
from
itself
In
the
previous
network
there
was
not
a
proper
weight
but
only
an
on/off
relationship
presence
of
a
reference-link
or
not
There
are
also
some
loops
produced
by
articles
citing
articles
published
in
the
same
journal
these
loops
correspond
to
journal
self-citations
The
resulting
journal
citation
network
is
shown
in
Fig

Out-citations

By
the

aggregation
process
we
can
construct
author
citation
networks
e.g
McCain

Radicchi
et
al

or
reach
higher

of

The
links
in
citation-based
maps
direct
citations
bibliographic
coupling
and
co-citations
Until
now
we
considered
only
citations
as
links
in
the
citation
network
The
presence
of
a
reference-link
between
two
publications
usually
attests
that
they
are
somehow
associated
for
instance
that
they
share
the
same
topic
or
research
method
see
Section
7

The
meaning
of
citations
Maps
in
which
the
links
are
direct
citations
are
called
direct-linkage
or
cross-citations
or
inter-citation
maps
Waltman
and
van
Eck
2012
In
science
mapping
however
there
are
two
other
common
techniques
used
to
measure
the
relatedness
or
strength
of
association
of
publications
or
their
aggregates
bibliographic
coupling
Kessler
1963
and
co-citation
Small
1973
Marshakova
1973
In
bibliographic
coupling
a
link
between
two
publications
is
established
when
they
share
at
least
one
publication
in
their
respective
bibliographies
i.e
when
they
have
at
least
one
reference
in
common
The
weight
of
the
link
is
proportional
to
the
number
of
shared
references
Co-citation
is
in
a
certain
sense
the
reverse
of
bibliographic
coupling
In
a
co-citation
network
a
link
is
drawn
between
two
publications
if
they
are
cited
together
at
least
by
a
third
publication
and
the
weight
of
the
link
the
so-called
co-citation
strength
is
proportional
to
the
number
of
common
citations
they
gather
i.e
the
number
of
co-citations
Fig
4
shows
the
bibliographic
coupling
network
generated
from
the
citation
network
of
Fig

Note
that
publication
f
has
no
link
with
other
publications
because
in
our
example
it
did
not
have
any
cited
reference
i.e
no
out-going
link

Note
that

e
has

the

Note
that
citations
are
directed
links
because
we
can
distinguish
between
a
sender
and
a
receiver
of
the
citation
In
network
theory
terminology
they
are
called
arcs
Wasserman
and
Faust
1994
In
contrast
bibliographic
coupling
and
co-citation
links
are
un-directed
links
because
bibliographic
couplings
and
co-citations
are
symmetrical
In
network
theory
terminology
they
are
called
edges
Wasserman
and
Faust
1994
Starting
from
a
matrix
whose
rows
are
the
citing
publications
and
columns
are
the
cited
publications
it
is
possible
to
derive
by
matrix
algebra
operations
the
two
co-occurrence
matrices
representing
the
bibliographic
coupling
network
or
the
co-citation
network
Van
Raan
2019
Note
that
direct
citations
bibliographic
coupling
and
co-citation
analysis
can
be
applied
not
only
to
single
publications
but
also
to
aggregates
of
publications
For
instance
if
authors
are
used
as
units
in
co-citation
analysis
we
have
author
co-citation
analysis
e.g
White
and
McCain
1998
Kreuzman
2001
if
journals
are
used
as
units
we
have
journal
co-citation
analysis
e.g
McCain
1991
By
combining
in
this
way
methods
and
units
of
analysis
several
types
of
bibliometric
networks
can
be
generated

The

A

Size
of
the

is
proportional

the
number
of

the

thickness
of
the

is
proportional
to
the
co-citation
strength
nodes
colors
indicate
the

to
which
they
are
attributed
by
the

algorithm
Nodes
are
positioned
according
to
their
co-citation
strength
so
that
the
more
frequently
they
are
cited
together
the
closer
they
appear

Normalization
Usually
the
raw
frequencies
of
citations
bibliographic
couplings
or
co-citations
are
not
directly
used
as
input
of
the
visualization
process
that
leads
to
the
final
form
of
the
science
map
This
is
because
the
raw
frequencies
do
not
properly
reflect
the
similarity
between
the
items
van
Eck
and
Waltman
2009
To
understand
why
suppose
that
department
AA
and
department
BB
publish
comparable
articles
but
department
AA
having
more
researchers
than
department
BB
publishes
10
times
more
articles
Other
things
being
equal
one
would
expect
that
the
articles
from
department
AA
will
receive
in
total
about
ten
times
as
many
citations
as
the
articles
from
department
BB
and
thus
to
have
about
ten
times
as
many
co-citations
with
other
departments
in
the
same
discipline
as
department
BB
However
the
fact
that
department
AA
has
more
co-citations
with
other
departments
than
department
BB
does
not
indicate
that
it
is
more
similar
to
other
departments
than
department
BB
It
only
shows
that
department
AA
publishes
more
articles
than
department
BB
because
it
is
bigger
To
correct
such
a
distortion
due
to
the
different
size
of
the
units
of
analysis
we
need
to
transform
the
raw
co-citation
scores
adjusting
them
by
some
stable
quantity
an
operation
called
normalization
Eck
et
al
2010
In
science
mapping
similarity
measures
are
used
to
perform
such
a
normalization
Following
Ahlgren
and
colleagues
we
distinguish
two
main
approaches
to
calculating
these
similarities
the
local
or
direct
and
the
global
or
indirect
Ahlgren
Jarneving
and
Rousseau
2003
In
the
former
approach
the
focus
is
on
the
co-occurrence
frequencies
of
the
items
that
are
then
adjusted
for
different
quantities
Examples
include
the
cosine
the
most
popular
one
the
association
strength
used
in
VOSviewer
see
the
Appendix
the
inclusion
index
and
the
Jaccard
index
Eck
and
Waltman
2009
In
the
latter
approach
the
focus
is
on
the
way
two
items
are
related
to
all
the
other
items
in
the
dataset
under
study
This
means
that
what
is
compared
to
obtain
the
similarity
between
two
items
are
their
entire
profiles
i.e
the
entire
rows
or
columns
of
the
co-occurrence
matrix
and
not
their
simple
co-occurrence
frequency
Pearson’s
correlation
coefficient
r
the
cosine
11
and
the
chi-squared
distance
are
examples
of
indirect
similarity
measure
based
on
the
global
approach
McCain
1990
White
and
Griffith
1981
However
the
reliability
of
Pearson’s
r
as
a
similarity
measure
has
been
contested
Ahlgren
Jarneving
and
Rousseau
2003
Eck
and
Waltman
2008
In
general
there
is
no
agreement
on
what
the
best
normalization
procedure
is
and
on
what
similarity
measures
should
be
used
in
science
mapping

Klavans

In
the
scientometric
community
the
discussion
still
goes
on
after
35
years
e.g
Zhou

Leydesdorff

However
it
is
important
to
remember
that
depending
on
the
chosen
procedure
the
resulting
science
maps
can
be
rather
different

Visualization
Visualization
is
the
step
in
the
science
mapping
process
in
which
the
information
contained
in
the
network
is
displayed
in
a
visual
layout
comprehensible
to
human
understanding
Following
Waltman
and
van
Eck
2014
we
distinguish
two
basic
types
of
visualizations
graph-based
and
distance-based
They
are
not
the
only
approaches
available
but
are
probably
the
most
common
in
science
mapping
12
In
graph-based
visualization
the
network
is
visualized
as
a
graph
made
of
nodes
and
edges
Fig
1
2
3
4
and
5
are
examples
of
graph-based
visualizations
The
edges
links
between
nodes
are
displayed
to
indicate
the
relatedness
of
nodes
The
most
common
technique
for
creating
such
graphs
are
force-directed
graph
drawing
algorithms
such
as
the
Kamada
and
Kawai
and
the
Fruchterman
and
Reingold
Chen
2013
To
understand
the
underlying
mechanism
of
these
algorithms
imagine
the
network
as
a
physical
system
in
which
the
nodes
are
little
balls
electrically
charged
and
the
links
are
springs
that
connect
them
The
electric
charge
creates
a
repulsive
force
between
the
balls
counterbalanced
by
the
attractive
force
generated
by
the
springs
The
algorithms
basically
simulate
the
network
as
such
a
physical
system
made
of
balls
and
springs
and
apply
two
opposite
forces
to
the
nodes
one
attractive
proportional
to
the
weight
of
the
link
between
two
nodes
and
the
other
repulsive
until
the
system
comes
to
a
state
of
mechanical
equilibrium
The
final
layout
is
the
one
corresponding
to
such
an
equilibrium
state
Note
that
several
configurations
are
possible
since
usually
there
is
no
unique
equilibrium
state
Force-directed
graph
drawing
algorithms
are
implemented
in
software
for
network
analysis
and
visualization
such
as
Gephi
13
and
Pajek
14
An
example
of
a
graph-based
science
map
created
with
Pajek
and
visualized
with
the
Kamada
and
Kawai
algorithm
can

Leydesdorff

The
other
visualization
approach
is
distance-based
In
distance-based
visualizations
the
distance
of
nodes
on
the
map
reflects
their
similarity
so
that
similar
nodes
are
placed
closer
and
dissimilar
nodes
far
away
Note
that
in
graph-based
visualization
on
the
other
hand
the
position
of
the
nodes
is
not
directly
related
to
their
similarities
but
it
is
a
product
of
the
pull
and
push
mechanism
of
the
drawing
algorithm
In
distance-based
visualizations
links
can
be
shown
or
not
Distance-based
visualizations
are
conceptually
closer
to
geographic
maps
than
graph-based
visualizations
Geographic
maps
represent
relationships
in
space
by
placing
objects
that
are
close
in
the
physical
space
near
on
the
maps
and
objects
that
are
distant
in
the
physical
space
further
apart
on
the
map
Distance-based
maps
have
the
same
goals
but
instead
of
being
based
on
physical
distances
they
are
based
on
similarities
between
objects
To
produce
a
distance-based
visualization
therefore
the
similarities
between
the
nodes
must
be
transformed
into
distances
15
The
distance
matrix
that
is
thus
obtained
is
conceptually
analogous
to
the
table
reporting
the
distances
between
pairs
of
cities
in
a
geographic
atlas
The
task
consists
of
reconstructing
from
the
relative
distances
the
positions
of
the
items
on
the
map
i.e
in
finding
the
coordinates
of
the
items
in
a
two-dimensional
space
starting
from
their
reciprocal
distances
To
fulfill
this
task
several
statistical
techniques
have
been
developed
The
most
important
belong
to
the
family
of
multi-dimensional
scaling
MDS
methods
Borg
and
Groenen
2010
They
aim
to
find
the
coordinates
of
the
points
in
a
lower-dimensional
space
usually
a
plane
such
that
the
distances
of
the
points
on
the
lower-dimensional
space
reflect
as
accurately
as
possible
the
original
distances
of
the
points
The
average
difference
between
the
distances
on
the
map
and
the
original
distances
tells
us
how
much
the
map
distorts
the
original
configuration
The
amount
of
distortion
is
used
to
calculate
the
stress
of
the
map
The
various
algorithms
for
MDS
essentially
adjust
the
positions
of
the
points
until
a
minimum
value
of
stress
is
reached
16
It
is
important
to
underlie
that
distance-based
visualizations
can
be
rotated
flipped
and
mirrored
Since
the
output
of
MDS
is
not
a
set
of
fixed
coordinates
but
a
set
of
relative
distances
between
the
points
any
geometrical
transformations
that
leave
them
unaltered
can
be
applied
An
example
of
distance-based
visualization
can
be
found
in
White
and
McCain
1998
fig
2
When
interpreting
the
output
of
MDS
that
is
usually
a
two-dimensional
map
is
it
very
important
to
be
aware
that
the
algorithms
can
generate
visual
artifacts
i.e
structures
or
patterns
that
are
visible
on
the
map
but
that
are
not
present
in
the
original
data
For
instance
Eck
and
co-authors
2010
note
that
variants
of
MDS
tend
to
produce
quasi-circular
layout
when
used
on
big
matrices
and
that
they
tend
to
locate
items
with
a
high
number
of
co-occurrences
toward
the
center
of
the
map
However
the
trickiest
artifacts
have
to
do
with
the
issue
of
dimensionality
reduction
i.e
with
the
very
core
of
MDS
Imagine
that
we
have
four
points
in
a
three-dimensional
space
each
one
located
at
the
same
distance
from
the
others
like
the
vertices
of
a
three-sided
pyramid
all
sides
of
equal
length
Borg
and
Groenen
2010
chap
13
3
When
we
try
to
place
the
four
points
in
a
two-dimensional
plane
we
can
respect
the
equal
distance
only
for
three
points
out
of
four
The
fourth
point
will
lie
almost
at
the
center
of
a
bi-dimensional
triangle
as
if
we
were
looking
at
the
pyramid
from
the
above
so
that
its
distance
from
the
other
points
will
always
be
shorter
than
the
distances
between
the
three
points
themselves
17
Without
knowing
the
original
three-dimensional
structure
and
by
looking
only
at
the
two-dimensional
map
we
would
wrongly
conclude
that
the
fourth
point
is
closer
to
the
other
three
The
wrong
conclusion
raises
from
the
fact
that
the
two-dimensional
map
necessarily
distorts
the
three-dimensional
structure
because
it
suppresses
the
third
dimension
which
however
carries
essential
information
the
equal
distance
between
the
fourth
point
and
the
other
three
points
By
losing
such
information
it
introduces
an
artifact
Interestingly
MDS
can
generate
also
the
opposite
artifact
points
that
are
placed
far
away
in
the
map
can
be
however
connected
by
tunnels
in
hidden
dimensions
Leydesdorff
and
Rafols
2009
Imagine
a
paper
sheet
with
two
distant
points
on
it
if
we
bend
the
sheet
we
can
make
the
two
points
very
close
in
the
third
dimension
realizing
a
tunnel
between
them
If
we
consider
only
their
distance
on
the
two
dimensions
of
the
sheet
however
they
will
appear
to
be
distant
In
sum
dimensionality
reduction
techniques
do
allow
us
to
obtain
significant
insights
into
the
structure
of
bibliometric
networks
because
they
reveal
the
main
features
of
such
a
structure
At
the
same
time
since
those
features
may
lie
in
more
than
two
dimensions
one
must
be
aware
of
the
inevitable
distortions
introduced
by
the
dimensionality
reduction
itself

Enriching
the
map
With
the
visualization
of
the
network
we
reach
the
basic
form
of
the
science
map
At
this
point
the
interpretation
of
the
map
can
already
begin
However
it
is
common
to
enrich
the
basic
form
by
displaying
further
information
on
it
A
first
option
is
to
use
the
size
of
the
nodes
and
the
width
of
the
links
to
convey
their
properties
In
a
co-citation
map
for
instance
the
size
of
the
nodes
can
be
used
to
represent
the
number
of
citations
collected
by
the
units
of
analysis
publication
journal
author
etc
and
the
links
can
be
drawn
thicker
or
darker
to
express
the
strength
of
the
connections
e.g
number
of
co-citations
between
two
nodes
Alternatively
the
size
of
the
nodes
can
be
used
to
represent
the
centrality
of
the
nodes
using
one
of
the
different
notions
of
centrality
defined
in
network
theory
The
most
common
include
degree
centrality
betweenness
centrality
closeness
centrality
and
eigenvector
centrality
Wasserman
and
Faust
1994
The
degree
centrality
of
a
node
is
proportional
to
the
number
of
its
links
so
that
it
is
higher
for
highly
connected
nodes
Betweenness
is
a
measure
of
brokerage
of
gatekeeping
that
is
of
how
much
a
node
is
an
obligatory
passage
in
the
network
In
science
mapping
it
is
sometimes
used
to
measure
interdisciplinarity
Leydesdorff
2007
Closeness
measures
how
close
a
node
is
to
the
other
nodes
in
the
network
Nodes
with
high
closeness
are
the
ones
that
can
be
reached
with
few
steps
18
from
any
other
node
in
the
network
Lastly
eigenvector
centrality
is
a
measure
of
the
influence
of
a
node
in
the
network
The
underlying
idea
of
eigenvector
centrality
is
that
the
influence
of
a
node
depends
on
the
influence
of
the
nodes
to
which
it
is
connected
so
that
a
node
connected
with
other
central
nodes
increases
its
centrality
A
further
option
to
enrich
the
map
is
to
use
colors
to
distinguish
visually
different
clusters
of
nodes
Networks
typically
display
an
internal
organization
in
clusters
or
communities
that
is
groups
of
highly
interconnected
nodes
Radicchi
Fortunato
and
Vespignani
2012
In
distance-based
visualizations
clusters
result
as
sets
of
close
points
separated
from
other
clusters
by
blank
space
The
techniques
of
cluster
analysis
can
be
used
to
detect
such
communities
One
common
method
is
hierarchical
agglomerative
clustering
Chen
2013
All
the
units
of
the
map
the
nodes
begin
alone
in
groups
of
size
one
then
at
each
iteration
of
the
clustering
algorithm
similar
groups
are
merged
until
all
the
nodes
belong
to
one
super-cluster
A
resolution
parameter
controls
the
granularity
of
the
clustering
i.e
the
size
of
the
communities
Different
agglomerative
methods
are
characterized
by
the
definition
of
distance
between
clusters
they
use
and
by
the
metric
employed
to
calculate
the
distances
there
are
lots
of
options
besides
the
familiar
Euclidian
distance
In
single-linkage
clustering
the
distance
between
two
clusters
is
set
equal
to
the
distance
between
their
closest
nodes
In
complete-linkage
clustering
on
the
other
hand
it
is
equal
to
the
distance
between
the
most
distant
nodes
in
the
two
clusters
Lastly
in
centroid
linkage
clustering
it
is
equal
to
the
distance
between
the
centers
or
average
points
centroids
of
the
clusters
These
clustering
procedures
however
are
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
available
techniques
and
algorithms
for
clustering
and
community
detection
In
the
last
years
the
techniques
based
on
modularity
originally
developed
in
physics
are
becoming
increasingly
popular
Thijs
2019

Clusters
can
be
labelled
automatically
by
extracting
terms
from
the
titles
abstracts
and
keywords
of
the
publications
in
the
clusters
Chen
2006
see
Section

Co-word
analysis
based
on
automatically
extracted
terms
Each
cluster
is
thus
provided
with
a
word-profile
and
its
most
relevant
words
can
be
superimposed
on
the
map
to
facilitate
the
interpretation
of
the
clusters
Chen
Ibekwe-SanJuan
and
Hou
2010
A
last
method
for
enriching
the
science
map
is
to
use
the
overlay
Rafols
Porter
and
Leydesdorff
2010
In
science
overlay
maps
the
results
of
the
mapping
are
laid
over
a
background
that
can
be
for
instance
a
global
map
of
science
The
background
serves
as
a
reference
system
that
facilitates
the
interpretation
of
the
results
For
instance
the
scientific
output
of
a
university
can
be
overlaid
on
a
global
map
of
science
to
get
an
insight
into
the
scientific
coverage
of
the
university
or
its
impact

Term-based
maps
Term-based
science
maps
are
used
to
extract
and
visualize
the
intellectual
content
of
a
corpus
of
publications
based
on
the
analysis
of
the
terms
associated
with
those
publications
Börner
Chen
and
Boyack
2005
These
terms
can
be
the
keywords
or
descriptors
of
the
publications
or
they
can
be
extracted
automatically
from
titles
and
abstracts
or
even
the
full
texts
of
articles
Term-based
science
maps
allow
to
explore
at
a
fine-grained
level
the
intellectual
content
of
publications
since
titles
abstracts
and
keywords
are
meant
to
report
the
main
topics
concepts
and
results
of
scientific
articles
He
1999
Van
Raan
and
Tijssen
1993
An
important
advantage
of
term-based
mapping
compared
to
citation-based
mapping
is
that
it
applies
to
fields
characterized
by
the
scarce
presence
of
citations
such
as
applied
research
and
technology
Callon
et
al
1983
Depending
on
the
method
by
which
the
terms
characterizing
a
publication
are
extracted
we
can
distinguish
two
types
of
term-based
maps
Classic
co-word
analysis
developed
by
Callon
and
colleagues
is
based
on
human-assigned
keywords
Natural
language
processing
NLP
based
co-word
analysis
on
the
other
hand
is
based
on
terms
that
are
automatically
extracted
from
the
texts
by
natural
language
processing
techniques
Independently
of
the
method
however
co-word
analysis
rests
on
some
assumptions
that
have
been
contested
The
main
one
is
that
words
and
terms
have
a
stable
meaning
across
fields
and
over
time
so
that
they
can
be
used
as
reliable
proxies
of
scientific
concepts
and
ideas
Leydesdorff
1997
However
this
assumption
may
be
false
and
historians
of
science
have
shown
that
the
phenomenon
of
meaning-shift
indeed
occurs
in
science
Kuhn
2000
A
possible
reply
to
this
criticism
is
that
words
in
co-word
analysis
are
not
used
as
carriers
of
meaning
but
as
simple
links
between
texts
Courtial
1998
From
an
operative
point
of
view
meaning
shift
can
be
avoided
by
restricting
the
time
scope
of
the
analysis
to
a
relatively
short
period
and
semantically
homogeneous
areas

Classic
co-word
analysis
and
the
strategic
diagrams
The
first
term-based
maps
were
developed
in
the
1980
s
by
a
team
of
sociologists
of
science
based
at
the
Centre
de
sociologie
de
l’innovation
at
the
École
des
mines
in
Paris
They
were
designed
to
study
the
interaction
between
scientific
knowledge
and
technological
innovation
and
more
generally
the
relations
between
science
and
society
Callon
et
al
1983
It
is
important
to
point
out
that
the
theoretical
foundation
of
co-word
analysis
developed
by
Callon
and
others
lies
in
the
tradition
of
the
science
and
technology
studies
and
in
particular
in
the
actor-network
theory
developed
by
Bruno
Latour
and
others
Callon
Law
and
Rip
1998
Latour
2003
However
as
a
mapping
method
co-word
analysis
can
be
employed
without
endorsing
such
a
theoretical
framework
Callon
and
colleagues
focused
in
particular
on
the
descriptors
employed
by
documentation
services
to
index
the
content
of
scientific
and
technological
publications
Callon
Courtial
and
Laville
1991
The
method
of
co-word
analysis
then
consists
first
in
collecting
all
the
descriptors
of
the
target
documents
After
a
process
of
cleaning
in
which
variants
and
synonyms
are
merged
and
not
relevant
descriptors
removed
see
Section
3
3
Data
cleaning
and
pre-processing
the
co-occurrence
frequency
of
each
pair
of
descriptors
is
calculated
Two
descriptors
co-occur
if
they
are
used
together
in
the
description
of
a
single
document
A
co-occurrence
matrix
reporting
the
co-occurrence
frequencies
of
each
pair
of
descriptors
is
thus
produced
and
the
raw
values
are
then
normalized
see
Section
4

Normalization
In
the
classic
co-word
methodology
as
described
by
Callon
and
colleagues
the
visualizations
produced
by
co-word
analysis
are
strategic
diagrams
sometimes
called
cognitive
maps
which
are
a
special
kind
of
science
map
that
should
not
be
confused
with
distance-based
visualizations
To
create
a
strategic
diagram
clusters
of
frequently
co-occurring
descriptors
or
keywords
are
created
by
some
clustering
technique
Such
clusters
are
called
themes
and
are
described
by
two
characteristics
centrality
and
density
The
centrality
of
a
cluster
is
given
by
its
external
link
i.e
the
number
of
links
it
has
with
other
clusters
The
density
of
a
cluster
is
defined
as
the
proportion
between
the
links
that
are
present
in
the
keywords
cluster
and
the
number
of
possible
links
Each
theme
is
thus
defined
by
two
variables
centrality
and
density
that
constitute
its
coordinates
in
the
strategic
diagram
He
1999
Then
the
strategic
diagram
is
divided
into
four
quadrants
Mutschke
and
Quan-Haase
2001
The
themes
in
the
first
quadrant
are
characterized
by
high
density
and
high
centrality
and
constitute
the
mainstream
of
the
scientific
field
The
themes
in
the
second
quadrant
characterized
by
high
centrality
and
low
density
are
unstructured
themes
that
may
be
described
as
bandwagon
themes
The
themes
in
the
third
quadrant
are
characterized
by
high
density
and
low
centrality
they
have
a
well-developed
maturity
but
lacks
ties
to
other
themes
in
the
field
They
are
the
ivory
tower
themes
Lastly
the
themes
in
the
fourth
quadrant
characterized
by
low
centrality
and
low
density
comprise
both
topics
that
are
fading
away
and
new
topics
that
are
emerging
In
longitudinal
analysis
the
trajectory
of
a
theme
can
be
followed
through
the
quadrants
of
the
strategic
diagram
An
example
of
a
strategic
diagram
can
be
found
in
Cobo

al

The
method
of
co-word
analysis
based
on
descriptors
or
other
kinds
of
keywords
may
suffer
from
the
so-called
indexer
effect
Law
and
Whittaker
1992
Indexing
may
reflect
the
prejudices
or
points
of
view
of
the
human
indexers
and
may
be
inconsistent
between
different
indexers
or
change
over
time
The
indexer
effect
is
a
problem
common
to
all
human-based
classifications
The
study
of
research
classification
systems

Co-word
analysis
based
on
automatically
extracted
terms
The
indexer
effect
can
be
partially
avoided
by
recurring
to
the
automatic
extraction
of
terms
from
titles
abstracts
or
even
the
full
texts
of
articles
However
even
if
this
method
does
not
rely
on
the
choices
of
an
indexer
it
is
not
free
of
human
intervention
In
fact
it
shifts
from
the
choices
of
the
indexer
to
the
choices
of
the
authors
of
scientific
publications
who
decide
what
words
should
be
included
in
the
titles
and
abstracts
The
issue
of
meaning
shift
therefore
is
not
solved
NLP
techniques
are
used
to
extract
terms
from
the
textual
data
Taheo
2018
In
general
terms
are
n-grams
i.e
sequences
of
n
items
usually
words
A
special
category
of
n-grams
are
noun-phrases
i.e
sequences
that
consist
exclusively
of
nouns
and
adjectives
and
that
end
with
a
noun
e.g
text
mining
network
analysis
Algorithms
for
term
detection
usually
comprise
several
steps
first
the
text
is
split
up
into
sentences
and
sentences
split
up
into
single
words
tokenization
then
so-called
stop-words
are
removed
words
such
as
and
or
etc
and
the
remaining
words
are
assigned
to
a
part
of
speech
such
as
verb
noun
adjective
etc
part-of-speech
tagging
Noun-phrases
are
then
identified
and
lastly
variants
e.g
plurals
are
merged
into
one
form
Once
the
list
of
noun-phrases
is
obtained
a
fraction
of
them
is
retained
A
common
strategy
is
to
select
only
the
most
relevant
noun-phrases
It
is
important
not
to
confuse
relevance
with
frequency
frequency
is
a
brute
measure
of
the
occurrences
of
a
term
whereas
relevance
can
be
conceived
as
a
measure
of
how
specific
a
term
is
Spärck
Jones
1972
To
understand
the
difference
between
the
two
take
a
term
such
as
method
In
the
scientific
literature
it
is
denoted
by
a
high
frequency
however
it
is
scarcely
relevant
to
characterize
a
scientific
article
since
is
occurs
probably
in
most
scientific
articles
Knowing
that
an
article
contains
the
term
method
is
a
very
thin
indication
of
its
content
Because
of
its
being
too
generic
method
therefore
has
a
low
relevance
A
term
such
as
cardiovascular
on
the
other
hand
is
less
frequent
than
method
but
conveys
more
information
about
the
specific
topic
of
an
article
Therefore
it
has
a
high
relevance
Relevance
scores
serve
to
discriminate
generic
from
specific
terms
A
common
metric
used
in
text
mining
to
calculate
relevance
scores
is
TF-IDF
short
for
term
frequency-inverse
document
frequency
Salton
and
McGill
1983
The
underlying
idea
is
that
the
relevance
of
a
term
is
proportional
to
its
occurrences
and
inversely
proportional
to
the
number
of
documents
in
which
it
occurs
Terms
that
occur
very
frequently
in
a
few
documents
will
score
higher
on
TF-IDF
than
terms
that
occur
very
frequently
in
most
of
the
documents
From
this
basic
idea
more
refined
metrics
to
calculate
the
TF-IDF
have
been
developed
Thijs
2019
After
the
selection
step
the
number
of
documents
in
which
each
pair
of
terms
appear
is
calculated
and
the
corresponding
co-occurrence
matrix
generated
The
process
is
then
the
same
as
citation-based
maps
Usually
the
raw
co-occurrence
frequencies
are
normalized
see
Section

Normalization
and
then
the
term
map
is
obtained
in
the
form
of
a
distance
or
graph-based
visualization

Further
techniques
such
as

can
be
applied
to

Enriching
the
map
Note
that
term-based
maps
thus
obtained
are
different
from
the
strategic
diagrams
produced
by
classic
co-word
methodology
They
represent
the
topics
recurring
in
the
set
of
publications
analyzed
rather
than
the
properties
of
their
themes
An
example
of

Figure

The
field
mapped
is
human
geography
The
nodes
represent
the
most
occurring
terms
in
the
field
Size
of
the
nodes
is
proportional
to
the
term’s
occurrence
A
link
is
drawn
between
two
terms
if
they
co-occur
in
the
same
title
or
abstract
The
thickness
of
the
link
between
two
nodes
is
proportional
to
the
number
of
co-occurrences
of
the
terms
The
color
of
the
nodes
corresponds
to
the
cluster
they
are
attributed
to
by
the
clustering
algorithm
Nodes
are
positioned
in
the
map
based
on
their
co-occurrences
so
that
terms
frequently
occurring
together
are
closer
on
the
map

Other
network-based
maps
Besides
citation
networks
and
term
networks
several
other
networks
can
be
used
to
generate
science
maps
In
this
section
we
briefly
present
co-authorship
networks
and
interlocking
editorship
networks
top

Co-authorship
networks
Co-authorship
networks
are
science
maps
in
which
the
nodes
represent
authors
and
the
links
the
relation
of
co-authorship
i.e
the
number
of
articles
authored
together
by
each
pair
of
authors
Newman
2001
Since
co-authorship
usually
implies
a
strong
relationship
of
collaboration
Katz
and
Martin
1997
Liu
et
al
2005
co-authorship
networks
are
used
to
reconstruct
and
investigate
the
social
networks
of
researchers
the
so-called
invisible
colleges
Crane
1972
It
must
be
remembered
however
that
co-authorship
is
only
a
proxy
of
scientific
collaboration
and
that
some
type
of
collaborative
work
occurring
in
research
e.g
the
work
of
laboratory
technicians
do
not
lead
automatically
to
the
authorship
Laudel
2002
More
generally
the
practice
of
authorship
and
the
requirements
for
being
awarded
authorship
varies
in
different
areas
Larivière
et
al
2016
Further
issues
that
complicate
the
interpretation
of
co-authorship
data
are
ghost
and
honorary
authorship
as
well
as
the
phenomenon
of
hyper-authorship
Cronin
2001
Especially
in
bio-medical
fields
there
is
evidence
that
sometimes
scientists
are
included
as
co-authors
of
articles
even
if
they
did
not
contribute
to
the
research
process
gift
or
honorary
authorship
while
others
are
denied
legitimately
earned
authorship
ghost
authorship
Wislar
et
al
2011
Honorary
authorship
can
artificially
inflate
the
relevance
of
some
researchers
in
the
co-authorship
network
whereas
the
ghost
authors
remain
simply
invisible
to
standard
co-authorship
analysis
Furthermore
in
some
areas
such
as
high-energy
physics
and
again
biomedicine
the
last
years
have
witnessed
massive
levels
of
co-authorship
Cronin
has
coined
the
term
hyper-authorship
to
describe
such
a
growing
phenomenon
of
publications
with
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
co-authors
For
instance
in
2015
a
publication
in
high-energy
physics
counted
5000
co-authors
Hyper-authorship
does
not
only
challenge
the
standard
conception
of
authorship
but
also
raises
several
issues
about
responsibility
and
accountability
which
have
been
widely
discussed
by
editors
of
biomedical
journals
see
e.g
ICMJE
2019
The
presence
of
hyper-authorship
is
an
important
factor
that
must
be
considered
when
a
field
is
investigated
by
of
co-authorship
networks
In
sum
co-authorship
networks
are
useful
tools
to
investigate
scientific
collaboration
but
since
they
are
based
on
formal
authorship
they
should
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
detailed
knowledge
of
the
authorship
practices
of
the
area
under
investigation
taking
into
consideration
also
possible
distortions
due
to
ghost
honorary
and
hyper-authorship

Interlocking
editorship
networks
Interlocking
editorship
is
a
method
to
map
relationships
between
journals
Two
journals
are
connected
in
the
interlocking
editorship
network
when
they
have
at
least
one
member
of
the
editorial
board
in
common
Baccini
and
Barabesi
2010
The
editors
of
a
scientific
journal
play
a
relevant
role
as
gatekeepers
of
scientific
disciplines
since
they
manage
the
peer
review
process
and
make
the
final
decision
on
the
publication
of
articles
Crane
1967
Therefore
interlocking
editorship
networks
can
be
used
to
reveal
groups
of
journals
whose
editors
endorse
similar
policies
Interlocking
editorship
networks
seem
to
be
highly
correlated
with
journal
co-citation
networks
showing
that
similar
editorial
policies
may
reflect
similar
intellectual
approaches
to
the
discipline

Other
types
of
science
maps
In
a
broader
sense
of
the
term
we
can
include
into
the
category
of
science
maps
also
other
visual
representations
of
science
that
are
not
directly
based
on
networks
of
scientific
publications
or
that
integrate
network
data
with
other
types
of
data
Maps
based
on
the
analysis

Maps
based
on
patents
data
Several
maps
can
be
generated
from
the
analysis
of
patents
which
are
especially
interesting
for
studying
the
dynamics
of
technology
systems
and
the
interaction
between
science
and
technology
Jaffe
and
Trajtenberg
2002
A
first
kind
of
patent
map
is
based
on
the
patents
meta-data
stored
in
patent
databases
Patents
like
publications
have
several
meta-data
such
as
the
applications
the
region
where
a
patent
is
in
force
the
classification
category
the
application
year
etc
Moreover
patents
frequently
include
references
to
the
scientific
literature
and
other
patents
as
well
All
these
meta-data
can
be
used
to
generate
networks
of
patents
or
networks
of
patent
features
Federico
et
al
2017
For
instance
Boyack
and
Klavans
created
a
map
of
patents
based
on
the
International
Patent
Classification
IPC
The
map
shows
the
relations
between
patents
based
on
their
co-classification
patents
that
are
classified
in
the
same
category
form
clusters
Boyack
and
Klavans
2008
Other
patent
maps
can
be
generated
based
on
the
citation
network
of
patents
applying
the
equivalents
of
the
direct
linkage
bibliographic
coupling
and
co-citation
methods
to
patents
Wartburg
Teichert
and
Rost
2005
Analyzing
the
references
to
scientific
publications
contained
in
patents
allows
tracing
the
links
between
scientific
knowledge
and
technological
applications
Meyer
2000
whereas
by
studying
the
scientists
that
are
both
authors
of
scientific
publications
and
inventors
of
patents
it
is
possible
to
map
the
overlap
between
scientific
and
technological
literature

increasingly
been

Geographic
maps
of
science
The
science
maps
we
presented
so
far
focused
on
the
abstract
spaces
of
science
such
as
citation
term
and
collaboration
spaces
Classic
science
maps
aim
at
visualizing
patterns
and
trajectories
occurring
in
these
abstract
dimensions
Science
however
is
also
a
concrete
activity
occurring
in
specific
places
on
our
planet
Finnegan
2015
In
fact
science
is
produced
in
geographic
sites
that
are
not
equally
distributed
on
the
Earth
but
are
concentrated
in
few
highly
developed
areas
From
those
sites
scientific
knowledge
travels
as
publications
and
researchers
move
around
the
globe
Geographic
maps
of
science
aim
at
describing
the
spatial
diffusion
of
scientific
activities
and
the
circulation
of
scientific
knowledge
in
the
geographic
space
They
are
a
key
research
topic
in
spatial
scientometrics
Frenken
Hardeman
and
Hoekman
2009
and
an
important
tool
in
the
geography
of
science
Livingstone
2003
By
showing
the
unequal
spatial
distribution
of
science
and
research
in
different
countries
they
offer
interesting
insights
into
the
structure
of
the
global
research
system
Wichmann
Matthiessen
Winkel
Schwarz
and
Find
2002
Geographic
maps
of
science
are
created
by
locating
on
a
geographic
map
e.g
a
map
of
the
Earth
the
nodes
of
the
network
we
focus
on
For
instance
the
authors
of
a
co-authorship
network
can
be
placed
on
the
map
based
on
the
coordinates
of
their
research
institutions
Or
a
network
of
cities
collaborating
in
the
production
of
scientific
papers
can
be
constructed
and
plotted
on
a
map
Leydesdorff

citation
flows
between
universities

The
representation
of
time
in
science
mapping
There
are
different
options
to
include
the
dimension
of
time
into
science
maps
A
first
option
consists
in
longitudinal
mapping
Cobo
et
al
2011
a
Petrovich
and
Buonomo
2018
Petrovich
and
Tolusso
2019
based
on
the
publication
year
of
the
bibliographic
records
subsets
of
publications
belonging
to
different
timespans
are
created
and
each
of
them
is
mapped
separately
Note
that
any
mapping
technique
can
be
used
from
co-citation
analysis
to
co-word
analysis
Each
map
will
represent
a
sort
of
photograph
of
the
field
under
investigation
in
a
certain
timespan
The
sequence
of
maps
allows
visualizing
the
temporal
dynamics
of
the
field
A
second
option
consists
in
representing
on
the
same
map
the
trajectories
of
the
units
that
change
their
relative
position
is
subsequent
maps
White
and
McCain
1998
A
third
option
is
animating
the
map
instead
of
a
static
visualization
a
short
movie
is
created
interpolating
the
layouts
of
the
network
in
different
moments
Leydesdorff
and
Schank
2008
The
first
maps
including
the
temporal
dimension
however
used
a
timeline
to
represent
time
Garfield
called
them
historiographs
Garfield
2004
In
the
timeline-based
approach
each
node
of
the
network
classically
a
publication
in
a
citation
network
is
linked
to
a
specific
point
in
time
e.g
the
publication
year
The
visualization
then
uses
two
dimensions
the
vertical
one
is
the
timeline
whereas
the
horizontal
one
is
used
to
represent
the
relatedness
of
the
items
Waltman
and
van
Eck
2014
The
result
is
a
citation
network
spread
over
a
timeline
Garfield
tested
the
validity
of
the
historiographs
as
tools
for
reconstructing
the
history
of
science
by
comparing
the
narration
of
the
discovery
of
the
DNA
written
by
Asimov
with
the
historiograph
based
on
the
bibliographies
of
the
corresponding
publications
Garfield
1973
He
found
a
good
overlap
between
the
two
the
key
events
in
the
discovery
according
to
Asimov
appeared
also
in
the
historiograph
Alluvial
maps
are
another
form
of
timeline-based
visualizations
Starting
from
different
phases
in
the
evolution
of
a
network
the
networks
relative
to
each
phase
are
divided
into
different
clusters
and
then
the
trajectories
of
corresponding
clusters
in
subsequent
networks
are
visualized
as
a
stream
The
fusions
and
fissions
of
clusters
over
time
is
visualized
as
multiple
streams
flow
over
time

and
Bergstrom

Interpreting
a
science
map
Interpreting
a
science
map
means
linking
the
visual
and
geometrical
properties
of
the
map
to
substantive
features
of
the
mapped
area
or
field
For
instance
clusters
of
co-cited
publications
can
be
mapped
to
scientific
sub-specialties
or
research
topics
bibliographic
coupling
networks
can
be
interpreted
as
the
research
fronts
of
scientific
specialties
co-authorship
networks
as
invisible
colleges
of
scientists
and
clusters
of
journals
sharing
many
editors
as
structures
of
academic
power
The
interpretation
of
science
maps
typically
involves
close
interaction
with
experts
of
the
mapped
domain
i.e
experienced
researchers
that
have
a
deep
albeit
qualitative
knowledge
of
the
structure
of
the
target
field
Tijssen
1993
Good
science
maps
however
should
not
be
mere
quantitative
counterimages
of
the
qualitative
knowledge
of
the
domain
experts
They
should
provide
also
new
insights
and
useful
knowledge
for
science
policy
purposes
An
important
aspect
to
consider
in
the
interpretation
is
the
level
of
analysis
of
the
science
map
i.e
the
units
of
analysis
and
the
type
of
relationship
displayed
by
the
map
Units
and
relations
do
not
only
affect
the
scale
of
the
map
but
also
the
dimension
of
the
scientific
enterprise
that
is
captured
Term-based
maps
and
citation-based
maps
using
the
document
as
unit
of
analysis
highlight
the
epistemic
or
cognitive
dimension
of
science
what
philosophers
of
science
call
the
context
of
justification
Lucio-Arias
and
Leydesdorff
2009
They
show
the
shared
epistemic
base
of
a
field
Persson
1994
However
they
can
overemphasize
the
stability
of
scientific
knowledge
overshadowing
the
continuous
social
negotiation
of
scientific
claims
Knorr-Cetina
2003
Co-authorship
maps
author
co-citation
analysis
and
interlocking
editorship
maps
on
the
other
hand
shed
light
on
the
social
network
underlying
science
i.e
the
context
of
discovery
in
philosophical
terms
When
the
journal
is
selected
as
unit
of
analysis
the
communication
system
is
highlighted
Cozzens
1989
Hence
the
different
methodologies
of
science
mapping
offer
a
partial
representation
of
the
multi-dimensional
nature
of
science
and
scholarship
that
should
be
considered
during
the
interpretative
phase
General
theories
and
models
of
the
structure
and
dynamics
of
science
can
also
help
in
the
interpretation
of
science
maps
providing
general
interpretative
insights

Klavans

At
the
same
time
however
it
is
pivotal
to
consider
the
specific
academic
and
epistemic
cultures
of
the
field
under
study
The
interpretation
of
a
science
map
of
a
social
scientific
area
for
instance
cannot
be
based
on
exactly
the
same
concepts
than
the
interpretation
of
a
science
map
of
a
biomedical
area
as
the
social
sciences
and
biomedicine
differ
in
terms
of
research
methods
epistemic
culture
specialized
terminology
use
of
the
references
centrality
of
the
journal
system
and
so
on
The
humanities
are
a
good
case
in
point
to
highlight
the
importance
of
the
specificity
of
research
areas
Science
mapping
and
more
generally
scientometrics
and
bibliometrics
have
mainly
focused
on
the
sciences
since
the
times
of
Price
and
Garfield
Franssen
and
Wouters
2019
Bibliometric
methods
such
as
citation
analysis
were
tailored
to
the
citation
norms
and
practices
of
the
sciences
In
the
humanities
however
citations
are
frequently
used
not
only
to
refer
to
other
scholars
work
but
also
to
point
out
sources
and
primary
materials
the
equivalent
of
experimental
data
for
the
sciences
Hellqvist
2009
Negative
or
contradictory
citations
of
the
works
of
other
scholars
are
relatively
more
common
than
in
the
sciences
In
fields
such
as
philosophy
where
argumentation
is
the
key
epistemic
practice
critical
citations
play
a
central
role
Petrovich
2018
These
field-specific
citation
practices
must
be
considered
in
the
interpretation
of
citation-based
science
maps
of
humanistic
areas
Hammarfelt
2016
Moreover
publications
in
the
humanities
frequently
do
not
target
only
fellow
scholars
but
also
the
wider
public
audience
Nederhof
2006
This
changes
the
level
of
specialized
and
standardized
terminology
used
and
consequently
affect
the
capacity
of
term-based
science
maps
to
capture
themes
and
topics
23
To
these
interpretive
caveats
one
should
add
the
limitations
of
the
existing
databases
to
adequately
capture
publications
in
the
humanities
as
they
are
often
published
as
monographs
and
in
national
languages

Science
maps
and
the
philosophy
of
science
In
this
section
we
deal
with
some
epistemological
and
sociological
topics
related
to
science
mapping
We
start
by
asking
in
what
sense
science
maps
offer
objective
representations
of
science
then
we
discuss
the
difference
between
the
published
side
of
science
and
science
in
the
making
and
lastly
we
examine
in
more
detail
the
meaning
of
citations

1
On
the
objectivity
of
science
maps
Are
science
maps
an
objective
representation
of
the
structure
and
dynamics
of
science
Clearly
the
answer
greatly
depends
on
the
definition
of
objectivity
we
endorse
Daston
and
Galison
2007
Reiss
and
Sprenger
2017
In
the
previous
sections
we
saw
how
the
creation
of
a
science
map
involves
several
methodological
and
technical
decisions
from
the
science
cartographer
such
as
the
unit
of
analysis
the
mapping
technique
the
normalization
method
the
visualization
approach
the
clustering
algorithm
and
so
on
see
Section
3
Building
a
science
map
Each
decision
affects
the
results
and
lead
to
different
science
maps
Therefore
science
maps
even
when
they
are
generated
by
computer
software
should
not
be
conceived
as
free
of
human
intervention
Human
choices
occur
frequently
in
the
science
map
workflow
and
should
be
made
transparent
in
order
to
warrant
the
reproducibility
of
science
maps
Rafols
Porter
and
Leydesdorff
2010
Therefore
if
we
equate
objectivity
with
the
lack
of
human
intervention
the
so-called
mechanical
objectivity
then
science
maps
like
any
other
map
are
not
objective
Rather
they
result
from
a
combination
of
the
features
of
the
mapped
field
on
the
one
hand
and
the
methodological
decisions
of
the
science
cartographer
on
the
other
hand
However
we
should
acknowledge
that
no
map
including
geographic
maps
is
objective
in
this
sense
On
the
other
hand
if
objectivity
is
intended
as
inter-subjective
agreement
then
science
maps
are
objective
in
so
far
as
they
can
be
reproduced
by
different
researchers
as
long
as
that
they
follow
the
same
methodology
A
further
sense
of
objectivity
has
not
to
do
with
a
lack
of
human
interventions
but
a
lack
of
human
biases
According
to
some
authors
science
maps
are
more
objective
than
classic
literature
reviews
precisely
in
the
sense
that
science
maps
would
avoid
the
potential
biases
of
human
experts
e.g
Catherine
and
Doehne
2018
Kreuzman
2001
Small
and
Griffith
1974
Weingart
2015
The
idea
is
that
the
expert’s
knowledge
of
a
research
field
is
inevitably
constrained
by
his
or
her
reading
capacity
for
how
many
papers
one
can
read
they
will
always
represent
no
more
than
a
tiny
portion
of
the
literature
available
in
most
of
the
scientific
fields
Even
if
such
limitations
can
be
mitigated
by
recurring
to
teamwork
and
by
integrating
the
knowledge
of
many
experts
the
view
of
scientific
fields
that
can
be
achieved
in
this
way
will
always
be
partial
Thus
there
is
the
potential
risk
that
the
representations
of
the
scientific
fields
are
distorted
by
the
experts
viewpoint
if
not
prejudices
By
contrast
the
networks
on
which
science
maps
are
based
are
the
result
of
millions
of
micro-actions
performed
by
the
scientific
community
itself
such
as
the
choice
of
certain
references
or
words
Science
maps
allow
keeping
track
of
this
myriad
of
micro-actions
Consider
for
instance
the
bibliography
of
a
research
article
Since
the
authors
cite
other
publications
that
are
relevant
to
their
work
the
bibliography
can
be
conceived
as
a
very
partial
representation
of
the
field
to
which
the
paper
belongs
In
so
far
as
each
new
contribution
must
be
related
by
references
to
the
existing
body
of
knowledge
the
field
each
paper
can
be
compared
to
a
mirror
that
reflects
albeit
partially
the
entire
field
Amsterdamska
and
Leydesdorff
1989
It
is
a
sort
of
photograph
taken
from
a
certain
viewpoint
Hence
the
aggregation
of
the
bibliographies
of
thousands
of
articles
that
is
performed
to
produce
a
citation-based
map
can
be
compared
to
the
merging
of
thousands
of
partial
photographs
to
make
up
a
single
overall
picture
In
this
aggregation
process
different
publications
are
related
to
one
another
unwittingly
by
the
scientific
community
itself
According
to
some
authors
when
enough
large
aggregates
of
publications
are
considered
the
biases
occurring
in
the
individual
bibliographies
cancel
out
and
a
balanced
picture
is
obtained
Van
Raan
1998
The
underlying
assumption
is
that
at
least
on
average
the
citation
behavior
of
scientists
follows
a
normative
model
i.e
that
citations
are
given
because
of
the
scientific
content
of
the
cited
reference
and
not
because
of
non-scientific
motives
see
Section
7
3
The
meaning
of
citations
By
the
same
token
the
networks
of
words
visualized
in
term-based
maps
allow
reconstructing
the
terminology
of
a
scientific
field
because
they
reflect
thousands
of
terminological
micro-choices
made
by
the
researchers
when
drafting
the
titles
and
abstracts
of
their
papers
The
relations
between
the
different
terms
are
the
results
of
these
choices
Idiosyncratic
and
non-standard
terminological
would
again
choices
cancel
out
when
enough
publications
are
considered
In
sum
science
maps
would
be
more
objective
than
classic
reviews
because
they
are
the
result
of
a
bottom-up
approach
Petrovich
2019
b
Instead
of
the
traditional
top-down
approach
that
can
potentially
introduce
biases
in
the
field
representation
science
maps
allow
to
represent
the
point
of
view
of
the
scientific
community
on
itself
Small
1973
Small
and
Griffith
1974
Once
again
science
maps
are
not
objective
because
free
of
human
choices
Rather
they
are
objective
because
they
are
based
on
thousands
of
human
micro)choices
The
key
difference
between
these
micro-choices
and
the
decisions
taken
by
the
experts
in
the
top-down
approach
lies
in
the
large
number
of
the
former
It
is
such
a
large
amount
that
potentially
guarantees
the
cancelling
out
of
the
biases
and
thus
a
more
balanced
representation
of
scientific
fields
Far
from
being
the
view
from
nowhere
on
science
science
maps
are
the
collection
of
multiple
situated
viewpoints
on
science
A
last
point
about
the
objectivity
of
science
maps
is
worth
stressing
even
if
science
maps
provide
bottom-up
representations
of
science
nonetheless
they
remain
partial
from
some
points
of
view
First
a
science
map
cannot
represent
more
than
what
is
contained
in
the
data
on
which
it
is
based
Since
the
scope
of
data
depends
on
the
scope
of
the
bibliographic
databases
science
mapping
techniques
will
deliver
very
partial
representations
for
those
scholarly
fields
that
are
scarcely
covered
by
current
databases
such
as
some
areas
in
the
social
sciences
and
humanities
or
scholarly
production
in
national
languages
Franssen
and
Wouters
2019
Nederhof
2006
This
does
not
mean
that
science
maps
provide
false
or
distorted
representations
rather
that
they
ultimately
depend
on
the
scope
and
limits
of
the
data
on
which
they
are
generated
The
second
reason
why
science
maps
are
partial
is
subtler
and
it
has
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
bibliographic
data
and
how
they
represent
the
scientific
activity
We
discuss
this
topic
in
the
next
paragraph

Published
science
vs
science
in
the
making
A
defining
trait
of
standard
science
maps
is
that
they
are
generated
based
on
the
meta-data
of
scientific
publications
as
they
are
stored
in
bibliographic
databases
However
publications
research
articles
reviews
conference
proceedings
patents
etc
are
only
the
final
stage
of
a
long
and
often
rough
research
process
They
are
not
meant
and
should
not
be
considered
as
simple
mirrors
of
the
research
practices
themselves
Hyland
and
Salager-Meyer

Wouters

a
The
writing
of
a
scientific
paper
involves
the
construction
of
a
justificatory
structure
in
which
each
experiment
and
analysis
contribute
to
the
justification
of
the
paper’s
claims
Gross
et
al
2002
As
sociological
and
anthropological
studies
have
revealed
real
research
practices
can
be
a
lot
less
smooth
than
the
accounts
we
find
in
the
scientific
papers
Knorr-Cetina

Latour
and
Woolgar
1986
Townsend
and
Burgess
2009
Real
research
is
full
of
false
starts
blind
alleys
and
mistakes
Discoveries
may
occur
because
of
serendipity
or
intuition
the
order
of
the
experiments
can
be
different
both
from
the
research
plan
and
from
the
methodology
described
in
the
final
paper
research
targets
may
be
affected
by
changes
in
funding
availability
of
materials
and
expertise
even
academic
circumstances
Moreover
scientific
writing
is
a
literary
genre
that
follows
precise
rules
ranging
from
the
format
e.g
the
division
of
a
research
article
into
standard
sections
such
as
Introduction
Methods
Results
and
Discussion
to
the
writing
style
in
some
fields
an
impersonal
style
is
recommended
to
increase
the
objectivity
of
the
results
Bazerman
1988
Hyland
and
Salager-Meyer
2009
Swales
2004
Journals
guidelines
and
peer-review
reports
can
further
affect
the
final
form
of
a
paper
Since
standard
science
maps
are
based
on
the
published
side
of
science
they
cannot
be
used
to
investigate
any
research
practice
that
is
not
recorded
in
publications
Most
of
what
Bruno
Latour
has
called
the
science-in-action
thus
remains
out
of
the
reach
of
standard
science
mapping
based
on
bibliographic
databases
Note
however
that
science
mapping
as
a
method
can
be
potentially
applied
to
any
relational
feature
of
the
scientific
enterprise
Other
relational
features
describing
the
science-in-action
could
be
mapped
by
new
science
mapping
techniques
for
instance
informal
exchanges
between
scientists
at
scientific
congresses
e-mail
flows
between
laboratories
informal
collaboration
networks
not
resulting
in
co-authorship
etc
However
new
ad-hoc
databases
must
be
built
to
map
these
features
a
costly
and
time-consuming
enterprise

The
meaning
of
citations
Citations
are
pivotal
in
science
mapping
without
the
reference
links
connecting
scientific
publications
citation-based
maps
would
be
simply
impossible
However
citations
are
a
human
product
they
are
the
result
of
the
choices
made
by
the
authors
during
the
writing
of
their
scientific
papers
Why
do
scientists
choose
some
references
instead
of
others
Do
they
cite
only
because
of
the
scientific
merit
of
the
cited
works
How
does
the
citation
behavior
of
scientists
change
in
different
scientific
fields
In
traditional
citation
analysis
and
in
standard
science
mapping
citations
are
treated
equally
i.e
all
have
the
same
value
However
some
cited
papers
are
widely
discussed
while
others
are
perfunctorily
cited
Some
papers
are
even
negatively
cited
How
can
we
capture
the
different
functions
and
values
of
citations
Questions
like
these
are
discussed
in
scientometrics
and
sociology
of
science
under
the
label
of
citation
theory
Bornmann
and
Daniel
2008
Cronin
1984
Wouters
1999
b
Most
of
them
are
discussed
since
the
dawn
of
citation
analysis
and
still
do
not
have
received
definite
answers
A
complete
overview
of
citation
theories
is
out
of
the
scope
of
the
present
article
24
In
this
section
we
will
limit
to
present
the
two
main
approaches
in
so
far
as
they
can
help
to
interpret
and
contextualize
the
results
of
science
mapping
the
normative
theory
and
the
socio-constructivist
theory
The
normative
theory
was
proposed
within
the
framework
of
the
normative
sociology
of
science
developed
by
Robert
K
Merton
and
his
school
from
the
1960
s
Elkana
et
al
1978
Kaplan
1965
Merton
1974
According
to
this
theory
scientists
cite
to
pay
their
intellectual
debts
when
they
use
the
results
obtained
by
other
scientists
in
their
research
the
norms
of
science
demand
them
to
acknowledge
the
debt
by
explicitly
citing
the
relevant
papers
Citations
count
as
pellets
of
peer
recognition
and
play
a
fundamental
role
in
the
reward
system
of
science
they
serve
to
distribute
prestige
among
scientists
An
important
consequence
of
the
normative
theory
is
that
citations
can
be
considered
as
reliable
proxies
of
scientific
quality
or
impact
Thus
the
normative
theory
provides
a
theoretical
justification
for
the
use
of
citations
in
evaluative
contexts
However
the
main
claim
of
the
normative
theory
i.e
that
the
citation
reflects
the
scientific
merit
of
the
cited
document
author
or
journal
rests
upon
several
assumptions
e.g
that
citations
are
made
to
the
best
possible
works
that
all
citations
have
equal
weight
and
that
the
citation
of
a
document
implies
the
use
of
the
document
by
the
citing
author
Nicolaisen
2007
Both
the
main
claim
and
the
underlying
assumptions
have
been
criticized
The
socio-constructivist
approach
to
citations
is
grounded
in
the
socio-constructivist
sociology
of
science
a
sociological
paradigm
that
raised
in
different
forms
in
the
1970
s
partly
as
a
reaction
to
the
normative
school
Bloor
1991
Knorr-Cetina
2003
Latour
2003
According
to
socio-constructivists
scientific
facts
are
the
result
of
an
intricate
process
of
social
negotiation
among
different
actors
In
the
social
arena
of
science
scientists
use
any
means
necessary
to
advance
their
claims
and
achieve
a
high
status
in
the
scientific
community
No
normative
system
such
as
the
one
described
by
Merton
governs
their
actions
Socio-constructivists
maintain
that
citations
play
a
key
role
in
the
social
negotiation
of
scientific
facts
In
particular
they
are
used
as
means
of
persuasion
scientists
trade
on
the
authority
of
the
cited
authors
to
strengthen
their
claims
Citations
are
rhetorical
devices
that
can
be
compared
to
defense
lines
prepared
by
the
scientists
to
defend
their
results
from
criticisms
of
adversary
scientists
Socio-constructivists
note
also
that
scientists
often
distort
the
content
of
the
documents
they
cite
in
order
to
show
agreement
with
authoritative
sources
even
when
no
such
an
agreement
exists
The
reason
is
that
scientists
would
be
more
interested
in
who
they
cite
rather
than
in
what
the
cited
documents
say
Citations
therefore
would
reflect
the
social
dynamics
of
the
scientific
community
rather
than
the
accumulation
of
scientific
knowledge
An
important
consequence
is
that
they
cannot
be
used
as
proxies
of
scientific
quality
MacRoberts
and
MacRoberts
2018
Empirical
research
has
shown
that
neither
the
normative
nor
the
socio-constructivist
theory
offer
alone
complete
explanations
of
the
citation
behavior
of
scientists
The
motivations
for
citing
are
complex
and
multi-dimensional
sometimes
they
reflect
purely
scientific
reasons
as
the
normative
theory
holds
and
sometimes
obey
to
social-networking
purposes
as
the
socio-constructivist
theory
holds
Tahamtan
and
Bornmann
2018
Besides
the
motivations
of
scientists
also
the
characteristics
of
the
communication
system
of
science
journals
publishers
and
so
on
affect
the
probability
of
receiving
citations
Cozzens
1989
For
instance
publications
in
languages
different
from
English
tend
to
receive
on
average
fewer
citations
whereas
review
articles
tend
to
attract
more
citations
than
research
articles
Bornmann
and
Daniel
2008
The
citation
links
between
documents
and
authors
therefore
are
affected
by
many
different
factors
of
which
scientific
merit
is
only
one
When
interpreting
the
results
of
citation-based
science
mapping
we
should
not
overlook
the
complexity
of
the
citation
practices
that
determine
the
links
in
the
citation
network
An
understanding
of
the

Science
maps
and
science
policy
Since
the
first
experiments
in
science
mapping
in
the
1970
s
science
maps
have
been
presented
recurrently
as
helpful
devices
for
science
policy
and
research
management
The
idea
is
that
since
science
maps
offer
a
panoramic
viewpoint
of
the
research
landscape
they
can
also
help
to
navigate
it
Science
maps
would
offer
for
the
abstract
space
of
science
the
same
service
of
orientation
that
geographic
maps
provide
for
the
physical
space

What
is
their

One
important
advantage
of
science
maps
compared
to
classic
reviews
is
that
they
allow
also
the
non-experts
to
grasp
easily
and
quickly
the
main
features
of
a
scientific
field
because
they
rely
on
the
recognition
of
visual
patterns
rather
than
on
deep
scientific
expertise
Therefore
they
can
be
used
as
a
common
base
between
researchers
science
managers
analysts
and
policymakers
to
discuss
strategic
decisions
such
as
the
allocation
of
resources
Börner
et
al
2012
Noyons
and
Calero-Medina
2009
Nonetheless
science
maps
should
be
used
in
science
policy
contexts
with
a
clear
understanding
of
their
limits
science
maps
can
help
the
decision-making
but
they
do
not
provide
automatic
answers
From
this
point
of
view
science
maps
are
not
different
from
any
scientometric
indicator
they
provide
partial
representations
of
science
whose
correct
interpretation
should
take
into
account
many
different
factors
see
Section
7
1
On
the
objectivity
of
science
maps
25
Not
only
science
maps
are
error-prone
e.g
if
they
are
generated
based
on
an
incorrect
field
delineation
procedure
see
Section
3
2
Field
delineation
but
as
we
saw
above
their
production
involves
several
technical
decisions
that
can
deeply
influence
the
final
maps
see
Section
4
1
3
Normalization
and
Section
4

Visualization
It
is
pivotal
that
such
decisions
should
be
made
transparent
and
their
consequences
clear
to
the
analysts
and
the
policymakers
so
that
science
maps
do
not
turn
into
black
boxes
Rafols
Porter
and
Leydesdorff
2010
Fortunately
science
maps
are
usually
perceived
as
more
complex
objects
compared
to
mono-dimensional
scientometric
indicators
such
as
citation
counts
or
the
Journal
Impact
Factor
Thus
they
tend
to
stimulate
a
higher
level
of
reflexivity
in
their
users
compared
to
sheer
numbers
Such
reflexivity
should
always
be
preserved
in
science
policy
contexts
where
science
maps
must
not
be
treated
as
oracles
even
when
science
politicians
and
research
managers
desire
simple
and
straightforward
answers
When
using
science
maps
it
must
be
remembered
that
science
is
a
complex
system
where
simple
ready-made
answers
can
be
given
very
rarely

Conclusion
In
this
entry
we
have
seen
how
the
visual
representation
of
science
by
science
maps
takes
different
forms
depending
on
the
kind
of
data
the
unit
of
analysis
the
type
of
relation
examined
and
the
overall
mapping
approach
used
A
science
map
can
take
both
the
form
of
a
bibliometric
network
and
that
of
a
geographic
map
or
of
a
patent
map
Even
artistic
representations
of
the
sciences
have
been
called
in
a
derivate
way
science
maps
Börner
2010
Science
maps
find
application
in
different
domains
from
sociology
of
science
to
science
policy
from
scientometrics
to
information
visualization
As
we
have
seen
science
mapping
as
a
body
of
techniques
stands
at
the
crossroad
of
numerous
disciplines
scientometrics
library
and
information
science
citation
analysis
text
analysis
statistics
network
analysis
among
others
Given
this
manifold
of
methods
disciplines
and
uses
it
is
difficult
to
find
a
common
trait
that
identifies
the
uniqueness
of
science
mapping
Perhaps
what
most
if
not
all
science
maps
share
is
a
bottom-up
approach
to
the
investigation
of
the
structure
and
dynamics
of
science

Compared
with
top-down
KOSs
science
maps
aim
at
representing
science
starting
from
the
scientific
products
themselves
rather
than
from
more
or
less
a
priori
conceptual
schemes
In
this
sense
they
may
capture
those
structuration
forces
that
shape
the
overall
configuration
of
the
scientific
system
and
that
may
remain
invisible
to
top-down
KOSs
Science
mapping
may
be
valuable
to
shed
light
on
the
self-organizing
properties
of
the
scientific
enterprise
Lucio-Arias
and
Leydesdorff
2009
Hence
we
think
that
science
maps
can
be
of
interest
for
all
the
branches
of
meta-science
from
library
and
information
science
to
sociology
of
science
from
knowledge
organization
to
epistemology

Note
that
there
are
two
different
similarity
measures
a
direct
and
an
indirect
both
called
cosine
The
indirect
cosine
that
corresponds
to
the
original
cosine
introduce
by
Salton
and
McGill
Salton
and
McGill
1983
is
based
on
the
angular
distance
between
two
vectors
and
it
is
calculated
from
the
inner
product
of
the
vectors
Jones
and
Furnas
1987
The
direct
cosine
is
a
simplified
version
of
the
indirect
cosine
and
it
corresponds
to
a
variant
of
the
Ochiai
coefficient

Note
that
not
all
the
similarity
measures
fulfill
the
requirements
of
a
distance
metric
For
instance
negative
similarity
measures
such
as
the
ones
produced
by
Pearson’s
r
cannot
be
used
as
distances
because
a
negative
distance
is
meaningless
The
other
conditions
to
be
satisfied
are
that
the
distance
of
an
object
from
itself
should
be
zero
that
the
distance
between
A
and
B
should
be
equal
to
the
distance
between
B
and
A
symmetry
and
that
the
distance
from
A
to
B
is
at
most
as
large
as
the
sum
of
the
distance
from
A
to
C
and
the
distance
from
C

Appendix
Science
mapping
tools
Science
maps
can
be
generated
by
any
general
software
of
graph
analysis
and
visualization
such
as
Pajek
and
Gephi
However
in
the
last
years
several
dedicated
tools
have
been
developed
specifically
for
science
mapping
such
as
VOSviewer
CiteSpace
HistCite
Sci
2
Tool
SciMAT
Bibexcel
and
CitNetExplorer
In
this
section
we
briefly
present
CiteSpace
and
VOSviewer
the
two
most
popular
science
mapping
tools
Pan
et
al
2018
They
are
both
free
constantly
updated
and
provided
with
extended
user-guides
A
full
description
of
these
and
other
tools
can
be
found
in
Moral-Munoz
et
al
2019
CiteSpace
CiteSpacei
was
developed
by
Chaomei
Chen
in
2004
at
Drexel
University
USA
Chen
2006
Since
its
first
version
it
has
a
special
focus
on
the
temporal
dynamics
of
scientific
networks
Its
primary
goal
is
to
detect
emerging
trends
and
bursts
of
interest
in
a
knowledge
domain
Therefore
the
visualizations
it
produces
pay
special
attention
to
the
dynamical
aspects
of
the
mapped
domain
for
instance
the
number
of
citations
received
by
an
article
is
visualized
as
citation
tree
rings
in
which
the
thickness
of
each
ring
is
proportional
to
the
number
of
citation
received
in
a
given
time
slice
CiteSpace
also
highlights
pivotal
points
in
the
emergence
of
new
specialties
i.e
articles
denoted
by
high
betweenness
centrality
that
bridge
across
different
co-citation
clusters
After
the
dataset
is
downloaded
from
Web
of
Science
Scopus
or
other
compatible
bibliographic
databases
CiteSpace
allows
to
manage
the
entire
workflow
of
science
mapping
The
network
can
be
extracted
from
the
data
choosing
different
entities
as
nodes
author
institution
journal
country
cited
publication
terms
keywords
etc
The
dataset
can
be
split
into
time
slices
and
the
most
relevant
items
according
to
some
threshold
can
be
selected
e.g
top-cited
papers
in
each
time
slice
CiteSpace
offers
different
methods
to
normalize
the
raw
values
and
to
prune
the
network
in
order
to
retain
the
most
relevant
links
Maps
can
be
generated
both
in
the
form
of
graph-based
visualizations
and
timeline-based
visualizations
The
visualization
tool
allows
controlling
each
feature
of
the
map
from
the
layout
to
the
labels
of
nodes
links
and
clusters
to
navigate
the
map
and
to
select
specific
nodes
by
clicking
on
them
Tools
for
clustering
automatic
extraction
of
clusters
labels
citation
burst
detection
and
other
analyses
are
included
CiteSpace
is
a
very
powerful
software
and
it
produces
aesthetically
impressive
visualizations
However
it
needs
some
expertise
to
fully
take
advantage
of
all
its
features
We
suggest
it
to
advanced
users
who
already
have
some
skills
in
science
mapping
VOSviewer
VOSviewerii
was
developed
by
Nees
Jan
van
Eck
and
Ludo
Waltman
in
2010
at
the
Center
for
Science
and
Technology
Studies
CWTS
in
Leiden
The
Netherlands
Eck
and
Waltman
2010
If
the
first
versions
of
the
tool
focused
only
on
the
visualization
of
bibliometric
networks
the
new
versions
allow
to
manage
the
entire
workflow
of
science
mapping
A
special
feature
of
VOSviewer
is
that
it
produces
only
distance-based
visualizations
using
a
dedicated
technique
called
VOS
mapping
technique
where
VOS
stands
for
visualization
of
similarity
Eck
et
al
2010
Such
a
technique
is
a
variant
of
multi-dimensional
scaling
that
avoids
some
visual
artifacts
generated
by
classic
MDS
methods
see
Section

Visualization
VOSviewer
can
create
maps
based
on
any
network
data
e.g
Pajek
network
files
but
it
can
also
extract
the
network
from
bibliometric
data
It
supports
data
from
Web
of
Science
Scopus
PubMed
and
other
databases
The
Create
map
wizard
allows
the
user
to
extract
from
the
data
several
kinds
of
networks
Possible
nodes
include
publications
journals
authors
research
organizations
countries
keywords
terms
Links
can
be
co-authorship
co-occurrence
direct
citation
bibliographic
coupling
or
co-citation
links
Moreover
VOSviewer
uses
a
dedicated
clustering
technique
based
on
modularity
to
find
groups
of
similar
nodes
Waltman
van
Eck
and
Noyons
2010
The
nodes
are
then
colored
according
to
the
cluster
they
belong
to
The
size
of
the
nodes
and
links
is
used
to
show
some
nodes
or
links
property
such
as
the
number
of
citations
and
co-occurrences
VOSviewer
offers
three
visualizations
of
a
map
the
network
visualization
the
overlay
visualization
and
the
density
visualization
Zooming
and
scrolling
functionalities
allow
exploring
in
detail
the
map
In
the
overlay
visualization
properties
of
the
nodes
different
from
their
cluster
e.g
the
Impact
Factor
of
a
journal
in
a
journal
map
can
be
shown
in
different
colors
Compared
to
CiteSpace
VOSviewer
is
less
focused
on
the
dynamical
aspects
of
knowledge
domains
and
offers
fewer
tools
for
the
analysis
of
science
maps
However
it
is
very
easy
to
use
the
create
map
wizard
is
intuitive
and
the
distance-based
visualization
facilitates
the
interpretation
of
the
maps
We
suggest
it
to
the
novices
and
to
professionals
who
need
a
user-friendly
tool
for
science
mapping

A
review
of
some
of
this
week’s
daf
yomi
key
concepts
Shabbos
Chol
Ha’moed
Sukkos
Sanhedrin
By
Rabbi
Shmuel
Wise
Q
What
is
the
halachah
if
a
dead
man
kills
A
We
discussed
this
fascinating
issue
on
78
a
By
dead
man
we
mean
a
person
who
has
suffered
a
specific
mortal
injury
e.g
his
esophagus
has
been
severed
that
defines
him
as
a
halachic
treifah
Rava
there
states
that
if
someone
kills
a
treifah
person
he
is
not
liable
as
a
murderer
for
the
Torah
regards
this
man
as
already
dead
Rava
then
rules
that
if
the
treifah
person
kills
he
is
not
subject
to
the
death
penalty
unless
he
literally
committed
the
murder
in
front
of
the
court
Why
not
Because
of
the
requirement
that
testimony
always
be
subject
to
refutation
through
the
system
of
hazamah
Namely
we
require
the
possibility
that
future
witnesses
will
come
in
and
refute
the
first
testimony
by
reporting
that
the
earlier
witnesses
were
with
them
at
the
time
they
claim
to
have
witnessed
the
crime
The
Torah
decrees
that
the
new
testimony
completely
discredits
the
first
testimony
and
we
administer
to
the
original
witnesses
the
punishment
that
they
had
conspired
to
bring
about
on
their
victim
Based
on
the
above
we
could
never
bring
admissible
testimony
against
this
treifah
person
who
allegedly
committed
murder
For
in
the
event
that
new
witnesses
were
to
come
and
discredit
the
first
testimony
against
the
treifah
the
Torah
would
not
say
to
punish
the
false
witnesses
with
the
death
penalty
that
they
tried
to
bring
against
the
treifah
That
is
because
of
the
idea
mentioned
earlier
that
the
Torah
considers
the
treifah
to
be
already
dead
That
being
so
hazamah
which
is
defined
as
a
reciprocal
punishment
for
the
false
testimony
is
inapplicable
here
where
the
false
testimony
merely
sought
to
kill
a
person
who
was
already
considered
dead
killing
these
healthy
witnesses
would
not
be
reciprocal
Being
that
hazamah
could
never
apply
to
this
situation
the
original
testimony
against
the
treifah
can
never
be
accepted
to
begin
with
So
this
treifah
murderer
walks
scot-free
at
least
until
he
drops
dead
of
his
treifah
injury
Later
in
the
Gemara
Rav
Ashi
takes
this
concept
one
step
further
and
considers
a
case
in
which
treifah
witnesses
testify
that
someone
committed
a
capital
offense
and
subsequently
other
witnesses
testify
that
the
treifah
witnesses
testimony
was
false
they
were
with
us
at
the
time
Rav
Ashi
asserts
that
we
would
never
reciprocate
and
impose
the
death
penalty
on
the
treifah
witnesses
because
their
testimony
would
never
be
accepted
to
begin
with
Why
not
Because
if
we
take
the
case
one
more
step
it
is
evident
that
their
testimony
could
never
subject
them
to
a
hazamah
punishment
The
treifah
witnesses
aren’t
subject
to
hazamah
because
the
second
set
of
witnesses
aren’t
subject
to
hazamah
This
might
sound
puzzling
I
thought
it’s
the
first
group
of
witnesses
that
is
always
refuted
through
hazamah
the
second
group
is
always
the
party
responsible
for
falsifying
the
earlier
group
But
the
truth
is
that
in
theory
the
tables
could
turn
again
if
a
third
group
of
witnesses
testifies
that
it
cannot
be
true
that
group
2
was
with
group
1
because
they
group
2
were
with
them
group
3
at
that
time
If
this
happened
the
halachah
would
be
that
the
original
testimony
of
group
1
is
restored
and
group
2
would
be
subject
to
the
reciprocal
hazamah
punishment
In
our
case
however
we
wouldn’t
be
able
to
punish
group
2
since
their
false
testimony
that
the
treifah
witnesses
are
false
witnesses
and
therefore
deserve
the
hazamah
punishment
would
have
killed
people
that
are
already
considered
dead
The
bottom
line
of
all
of
this
argues
Rav
Ashi
is
that
we
could
never
kill
treifah
witnesses
who
attempt
to
falsely
testify
that
someone
committed
a
capital
offense
because
their
testimony
would
never
be
accepted
to
begin
with
Rava
however
does
not
agree
with
this
In
Rava’s
view
we
would
accept
the
testimony
of
treifah
witnesses
regarding
a
capital
offense
and
we
would
therefore
kill
them
if
they
were
exposed
as
false
witnesses
through
hazamah
What
of
Rav
Ashi’s
point
that
group
2
s
testimony
isn’t
subject
to
hazamah
and
consequently
should
be
rejected
altogether
with
the
result
that
the
treifah
witnesses
testimony
should
be
rejected
to
begin
with
as
explained
above
Rashi
explains
that
Rava
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
requirement
that
testimony
be
subject
to
hazamah
doesn’t
apply
to
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
who
are
exposing
the
previous
testimony
as
false
e.g
group
2
The
logic
for
this
is
as
follows
On
the
face
of
it
there
is
no
rational
way
to
explain
the
halachah
of
hazamah
For
why
should
we
believe
the
second
group
of
witnesses
any
more
than
the
first
group
which
obviously
claims
that
it
did
witness
this
crime
Yet
the
Torah
decreed
that
when
subsequent
witnesses
refute
the
earlier
testimony
through
hazamah
we
regard
the
earlier
witnesses
as
entirely
discredited
So
since
the
Torah
evidently
gave
superpowers
to
the
second
testimony
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
the
Torah
accepts
this
testimony
even
if
it
possesses
the
defect
of
not
being
subject
to
hazamah
In
other
words
if
the
Torah
upholds
this
testimony
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
two
other
credible
witnesses
have
contradicted
it
then
it
logically
follows
that
this
testimony
can
weather
the
relatively
minor
issue
that
it
lacks
the
built-in
deterrent
that
it
be
subject
to
refutation
by
hazamah
How
would
Rav
Ashi
respond
to
this
argument
Perhaps
Rav
Ashi
would
say
that
you
have
no
right
to
make
any
logical
extensions
from
a
law
that
is
clearly
not
governed
by
logic
This
viewpoint
can
be
compared
to
the
view
that
ironically
is
expressed
by
Rava
back
on
27
a
The
Gemara
there
explores
the
question
of
whether
we
apply
the
status
of
a
witness
whose
testimony
was
refuted
through
hazamah
retroactively
That
is
do
we
consider
any
testimony
he
had
given
between
the
false
testimony
and
the
date
on
which
he
was
falsified
to
be
testimony
given
by
a
liar
and
consequently
invalid
testimony
Rava
there
states
that
we
do
not
apply
this
false
witness’s
disqualified
status
retroactively
Why
not
Because
since
as
explained
above
the
whole
concept
of
hazamah
defies
logic
we
cannot
treat
it
as
a
regular
case
where
we
would
certainly
establish
the
person’s
status
from
the
moment
of
the
crime
itself
So
Rav
Ashi
could
apply
this
kind
of
argument
we
have
no
right
to
extrapolate
from
hazamah
and
say
that
the
Torah
also
exempted
the
requirement
that
testimony
be
subject
to
hazamah
We
must
stick
with
strictly
what
the
actual
verse
states
and
not
assume
anything
else
Which
begs
the
question
how
would
Rava
distinguish
between
the
issue
of
27
a
and
our
Gemara
Seemingly
Rava
is
playing
both
sides
of
the
fence
here
Perhaps
Rava
would
say
this
Indeed
as
is
clear
from
his
view
on
27
a
we
cannot
take
the
teaching
of
hazamah
beyond
its
bare-bones
teaching
which
is
that
when
later
witnesses
refute
these
witnesses
we
consider
them
false
witnesses
Because
this
is
a
novel

he

the

if
the

perforce
they

The
Higher
Learning
in
America
1918
CHAPTER
ONE
Introductory
The
Place
of
the
University
in
Modern
Life
I
In
any
known
civilization
there
will
be
found
something
in
the
way
of
esoteric
knowledge
This
body
of
knowledge
will
vary
characteristically
from
one
culture
to
another
differing
both
in
content
and
in
respect
of
the
canons
of
truth
and
reality
relied
on
by
its
adepts
But
there
is
this
common
trait
running
through
all
civilizations
as
touches
this
range
of
esoteric
knowledge
that
it
is
in
all
cases
held
more
or
less
closely
in
the
keeping
of
a
select
body
of
adepts
or
specialists
scientists
scholars
savants
clerks
priests
shamans
medicinemen
whatever
designation
may
best
fit
the
given
case
In
the
apprehension
of
the
given
society
within
which
any
such
body
of
knowledge
is
found
it
will
also
be
found
that
the
knowledge
in
question
is
rated
as
an
article
of
great
intrinsic
value
in
some
way
a
matter
of
more
substantial
consequence
than
any
or
all
of
the
material
achievements
or
possessions
of
the
community
It
may
take
shape
as
a
system
of
magic
or
of
religious
beliefs
of
mythology
theology
philosophy
or
science
But
whatever
shape
it
falls
into
in
the
given
case
it
makes
up
the
substantial
core
of
the
civilization
in
which
it
is
found
and
it
is
felt
to
give
character
and
distinction
to
that
civilization
In
the
apprehension
of
the
group
in
whose
life
and
esteem
it
lives
and
takes
effect
this
esoteric
knowledge
is
taken
to
embody
a
systematization
of
fundamental
and
eternal
truth
although
it
is
evident
to
any
outsider
that
it
will
take
its
character
and
its
scope
and
method
from
the
habits
of
life
of
the
group
from
the
institutions
with
which
it
is
bound
in
a
web
of
give
and
take
Such
is
manifestly
the
case
in
all
the
historic
phases
of
civilization
as
well
as
in
all
those
contemporary
cultures
that
are
sufficiently
remote
from
our
everyday
interests
to
admit
of
their
being
seen
in
adequate
perspective
A
passably
dispassionate
inquiry
into
the
place
which
modern
learning
holds
in
modern
civilization
will
show
that
such
is
also
the
case
of
this
latest
and
in
the
mind
of
its
keepers
the
most
mature
system
of
knowledge
It
should
by
no
means
be
an
insuperably
difficult
matter
to
show
that
this
higher
learning
of
the
modern
world
the
current
body
of
science
and
scholarship
also
holds
its
place
on
such
a
tenure
of
use
and
wont
that
it
has
grown
and
shifted
in
point
of
content
aims
and
methods
in
response
to
the
changes
in
habits
of
life
that
have
passed
over
the
Western
peoples
during
the
period
of
its
growth
and
ascendancy
Nor
should
it
be
embarrassingly
difficult
to
reach
the
persuasion
that
this
process
of
change
and
supersession
in
the
scope
and
method
of
knowledge
is
still
effectually
at
work
in
a
like
response
to
institutional
changes
that
still
are
incontinently
going
forward
1
To
the
adepts
who
are
occupied
with
this
esoteric
knowledge
the
scientists
and
scholars
on
whom
its
keeping
devolves
the
matter
will
of
course
not
appear
in
just
that
light
more
particularly
so
far
as
regards
that
special
segment
of
the
field
of
knowledge
with
the
keeping
and
cultivation
of
which
they
may
each
and
several
be
occupied
They
are
each
and
several
engaged
on
the
perfecting
and
conservation
of
a
special
line
of
inquiry
the
objective
end
of
which
in
the
view
of
its
adepts
will
necessarily
be
the
final
and
irreducible
truth
as
touches
matters
within
its
scope
But
seen
in
perspective
these
adepts
are
themselves
to
be
taken
as
creatures
of
habit
creatures
of
that
particular
manner
of
group
life
out
of
which
their
preconceptions
in
matters
of
knowledge
and
the
manner
of
their
interest
in
the
run
of
inquiry
have
sprung
So
that
the
terms
of
finality
that
will
satisfy
the
adepts
are
also
a
consequence
of
habituation
and
they
are
to
be
taken
as
conclusive
only
because
and
in
so
far
as
they
are
consonant
with
the
discipline
of
habituation
enforced
by
that
manner
of
group
life
that
has
induced
in
these
adepts
their
particular
frame
of
mind
Perhaps
at
a
farther
remove
than
many
other
current
phenomena
but
none
the
less
effectually
for
that
the
higher
learning
takes
its
character
from
the
manner
of
life
enforced
on
the
group
by
the
circumstances
in
which
it
is
placed
These
constraining
circumstances
that
so
condition
the
scope
and
method
of
learning
are
primarily
and
perhaps
most
cogently
the
conditions
imposed
by
the
state
of
the
industrial
arts
the
technological
situation
but
in
the
second
place
and
scarcely
less
exacting
in
detail
the
received
scheme
of
use
and
wont
in
its
other
bearings
has
its
effect
in
shaping
the
scheme
of
knowledge
both
as
to
its
content
and
as
touches
the
norms
and
methods
of
its
organization
Distinctive
and
dominant
among
the
constituent
factors
of
this
current
scheme
of
use
and
wont
is
the
pursuit
of
business
with
the
outlook
and
predilections
which
that
pursuit
implies
Therefore
any
inquiry
into
the
effect
which
recent
institutional
changes
may
have
upon
the
pursuit
of
the
higher
learning
will
necessarily
be
taken
up
in
a
peculiar
degree
with
the
consequences
which
an
habitual
pursuit
of
business
in
modern
times
has
had
for
the
ideals
aims
and
methods
of
the
scholars
and
schools
devoted
to
the
higher
learning
The
Higher
Learning
as
currently
cultivated
by
the
scholars
and
scientists
of
the
Western
civilization
differs
not
generically
from
the
esoteric
knowledge
purveyed
by
specialists
in
other
civilizations
elsewhere
and
in
other
times
It
engages
the
same
general
range
of
aptitudes
and
capacities
meets
the
same
range
of
human
wants
and
grows
out
of
the
same
impulsive
propensities
of
human
nature
Its
scope
and
method
are
different
from
what
has
seemed
good
in
other
cultural
situations
and
its
tenets
and
canons
are
so
far
peculiar
as
to
give
it
a
specific
character
different
from
these
others
but
in
the
main
this
specific
character
is
due
to
a
different
distribution
of
emphasis
among
the
same
general
range
of
native
gifts
that
have
always
driven
men
to
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
The
stress
falls
in
a
somewhat
obviously
different
way
among
the
canons
of
reality
by
recourse
to
which
men
systematize
and
verify
the
knowledge
gained
which
is
in
its
turn
due
to
the
different
habituation
to
which
civilized
men
are
subjected
as
contrasted
with
the
discipline
exercised
by
other
and
earlier
cultures
In
point
of
its
genesis
and
growth
any
system
of
knowledge
may
confidently
be
run
back
in
the
main
to
the
initiative
and
bias
afforded
by
two
certain
impulsive
traits
of
human
nature
an
Idle
Curiosity
and
the
Instinct
of
Workmanship
2
In
this
generic
trait
the
modern
learning
does
not
depart
from
the
rule
that
holds
for
the
common
run
Men
instinctively
seek
knowledge
and
value
it
The
fact
of
this
proclivity
is
well
summed
up
in
saying
that
men
are
by
native
gift
actuated
with
an
idle
curiosity
idle
in
the
sense
that
a
knowledge
of
things
is
sought
apart
from
any
ulterior
use
of
the
knowledge
so
gained
3
This
of
course
does
not
imply
that
the
knowledge
so
gained
will
not
be
turned
to
practical
account
In
point
of
fact
although
the
fact
is
not
greatly
relevant
to
the
inquiry
here
in
hand
the
native
proclivity
here
spoken
of
as
the
instinct
of
workmanship
will
unavoidably
incline
men
to
turn
to
account
in
a
system
of
ways
and
means
whatever
knowledge
so
becomes
available
But
the
instinct
of
workmanship
has
also
another
and
more
pertinent
bearing
in
these
premises
in
that
it
affords
the
norms
or
the
scheme
of
criteria
and
canons
of
verity
according
to
which
the
ascertained
facts
will
be
construed
and
connected
up
in
a
body
of
systematic
knowledge
Yet
the
sense
of
workmanship
takes
effect
by
recourse
to
divers
expedients
and
reaches
its
ends
by
recourse
to
varying
principles
according
as
the
habituation
of
workday
life
has
enforced
one
or
another
scheme
of
interpretation
for
the
facts
with
which
it
has
to
deal
The
habits
of
thought
induced
by
workday
life
impose
themselves
as
ruling
principles
that
govern
the
quest
of
knowledge
it
will
therefore
be
the
habits
of
thought
enforced
by
the
current
technological
scheme
that
will
have
most
or
most
immediately
to
say
in
the
current
systematization
of
facts
The
working
logic
of
the
current
state
of
the
industrial
arts
will
necessarily
insinuate
itself
as
the
logical
scheme
which
must
of
course
effectually
govern
the
interpretation
and
generalizations
of
fact
in
all
their
commonplace
relations
But
the
current
state
of
the
industrial
arts
is
not
all
that
conditions
workmanship
Under
any
given
institutional
situation
and
the
modern
scheme
of
use
and
wont
law
and
order
is
no
exception,workmanship
is
held
to
a
more
or
less
exacting
conformity
to
several
tests
and
standards
that
are
not
intrinsic
to
the
state
of
the
industrial
arts
even
if
they
are
not
alien
to
it
such
as
the
requirements
imposed
by
the
current
system
of
ownership
and
pecuniary
values
These
pecuniary
conditions
that
impose
themselves
on
the
processes
of
industry
and
on
the
conduct
of
life
together
with
the
pecuniary
accountancy
that
goes
with
them
the
price
system
have
much
to
say
in
the
guidance
and
limitations
of
workmanship
And
when
and
in
so
far
as
the
habituation
so
enforced
in
the
traffic
of
workday
life
goes
into
effect
as
a
scheme
of
logic
governing
the
quest
of
knowledge
such
principles
as
have
by
habit
found
acceptance
as
being
conventionally
salutary
and
conclusive
in
the
pecuniary
conduct
of
affairs
will
necessarily
leave
their
mark
on
the
ideals
aims
methods
and
standards
of
science
and
those
principles
and
scholarship
More
particularly
standards
of
organization
control
and
achievement
that
have
been
accepted
as
an
habitual
matter
of
course
in
the
conduct
of
business
will
by
force
of
habit
in
good
part
reassert
themselves
as
indispensable
and
conclusive
in
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
learning
While
it
remains
true
that
the
bias
of
workmanship
continues
to
guide
the
quest
of
knowledge
under
the
conditions
imposed
by
modern
institutions
it
will
not
be
the
naive
conceptions
of
primitive
workmanship
that
will
shape
the
framework
of
the
modern
system
of
learning
but
rather
the
preconceptions
of
that
disciplined
workmanship
that
has
been
instructed
in
the
logic
of
the
modern
technology
and
sophisticated
with
much
experience
in
a
civilization
in
whose
scheme
of
life
pecuniary
canons
are
definitive
The
modern
technology
is
of
an
impersonal
matter-of-fact
character
in
an
unexampled
degree
and
the
accountancy
of
modern
business
management
is
also
of
an
extremely
dispassionate
and
impartially
exacting
nature
It
results
that
the
modern
learning
is
of
a
similarly
matter-of-fact
mechanistic
complexion
and
that
it
similarly
leans
on
statistically
dispassionate
tests
and
formulations
Whereas
it
may
fairly
be
said
that
the
personal
equation
once
in
the
days
of
scholastic
learning
was
the
central
and
decisive
factor
in
the
systematization
of
knowledge
it
is
equally
fair
to
say
that
in
later
time
no
effort
is
spared
to
eliminate
all
bias
of
personality
from
the
technique
or
the
results
of
science
or
scholarship
It
is
the
dry
light
of
science
that
is
always
in
request
and
great
pains
is
taken
to
exclude
all
color
of
sentimentality
Yet
this
highly
sterilized
germ-proof
system
of
knowledge
kept
in
a
cool
dry
place
commands
the
affection
of
modern
civilized
mankind
no
less
unconditionally
with
no
more
afterthought
of
an
extraneous
sanction
than
once
did
the
highly
personalized
mythological
and
philosophical
constructions
and
interpretations
that
had
the
vogue
in
the
days
of
the
schoolmen
Through
all
the
mutations
that
have
passed
over
this
quest
of
knowledge
from
its
beginnings
in
puerile
myth
and
magic
to
its
provisional
consummation
in
the
exact
sciences
of
the
current
fashion
any
attentive
scrutiny
will
find
that
the
driving
force
has
consistently
been
of
the
same
kind
traceable
to
the
same
proclivity
of
human
nature
In
so
far
as
it
may
fairly
be
accounted
esoteric
knowledge
or
a
higher
learning
all
this
enterprise
is
actuated
by
an
idle
curiosity
a
disinterested
proclivity
to
gain
a
knowledge
of
things
and
to
reduce
this
knowledge
to
a
comprehensible
system
The
objective
end
is
a
theoretical
organization
a
logical
articulation
of
things
known
the
lines
of
which
must
not
be
deflected
by
any
consideration
of
expediency
or
convenience
but
must
run
true
to
the
canons
of
reality
accepted
at
the
time
These
canons
of
reality
or
of
verity
have
varied
from
time
to
time
have
in
fact
varied
incontinently
with
the
passage
of
time
and
the
mutations
of
experience
As
the
fashions
of
modern
time
have
come
on
particularly
the
later
phases
of
modern
life
the
experience
that
so
has
shaped
and
reshaped
the
canons
of
verity
for
the
use
of
inquiring
minds
has
fallen
more
and
more
into
the
lines
of
mechanical
articulation
and
has
expressed
itself
ever
more
unreservedly
in
terms
of
mechanical
stress
Concomitantly
the
canons
of
reality
have
taken
on
a
mechanistic
complexion
to
the
neglect
and
progressive
disuse
of
all
tests
and
standards
of
a
more
genial
sort
until
in
the
off-hand
apprehension
of
modern
men
reality
comes
near
being
identified
with
mechanical
fact
and
verification
is
taken
to
mean
a
formulation
in
mechanical
terms
But
the
final
test
of
this
reality
about
which
the
inquiries
of
modern
men
so
turn
is
not
the
test
of
mechanical
serviceability
for
human
use
but
only
of
mechanistically
effectual
matter-of-fact
So
it
has
come
about
that
modern
civilization
is
in
a
very
special
degree
a
culture
of
the
intellectual
powers
in
the
narrower
sense
of
the
term
as
contrasted
with
the
emotional
traits
of
human
nature
Its
achievements
and
chief
merits
are
found
in
this
field
of
learning
and
its
chief
defects
elsewhere
And
it
is
on
its
achievements
in
this
domain
of
detached
and
dispassionate
knowledge
that
modern
civilized
mankind
most
ingenuously
plumes
itself
and
confidently
rests
its
hopes
The
more
emotional
and
spiritual
virtues
that
once
held
the
first
place
have
been
overshadowed
by
the
increasing
consideration
given
to
proficiency
in
matter-of-fact
knowledge
As
prime
movers
in
the
tide
of
civilized
life
these
sentimental
movements
of
the
human
spirit
belong
in
the
past
at
least
such
is
the
self-complacent
avowal
of
the
modern
spokesmen
of
culture
The
modern
technology
and
the
mechanistic
conception
of
things
that
goes
with
that
technology
are
alien
to
the
spirit
of
the
Old
Order
The
Church
the
court
the
camp
the
drawing-room
where
these
elder
and
perhaps
nobler
virtues
had
their
laboratory
and
playground
have
grown
weedy
and
gone
to
seed
Much
of
the
apparatus
of
the
old
order
with
the
good
old
way
still
stands
over
in
a
state
of
decent
repair
and
the
sentimentally
reminiscent
endeavors
of
certain
spiritual
hold-overs
still
lend
this
apparatus
of
archaism
something
of
a
galvanic
life
But
that
power
of
aspiration
that
once
surged
full
and
hot
in
the
cults
of
faith
fashion
sentiment
exploit
and
honor
now
at
its
best
comes
to
such
a
head
as
it
may
in
the
concerted
adulation
of
matter-of-fact
This
esoteric
knowledge
of
matter-of-fact
has
come
to
be
accepted
as
something
worth
while
in
its
own
right
a
self-legitimating
end
of
endeavor
in
itself
apart
from
any
bearing
it
may
have
on
the
glory
of
God
or
the
good
of
man
Men
have
no
doubt
always
been
possessed
of
a
more
or
less
urgent
propensity
to
inquire
into
the
nature
of
things
beyond
the
serviceability
of
any
knowledge
so
gained
and
have
always
been
given
to
seeking
curious
explanations
of
things
at
large
The
idle
curiosity
is
a
native
trait
of
the
race
But
in
past
times
such
a
disinterested
pursuit
of
unprofitable
knowledge
has
by
and
large
not
been
freely
avowed
as
a
legitimate
end
of
endeavour
or
such
has
at
any
rate
been
the
state
of
the
case
through
that
later
segment
of
history
which
students
commonly
take
account
of
A
quest
of
knowledge
has
overtly
been
rated
as
meritorious
or
even
blameless
only
in
so
far
as
it
has
appeared
to
serve
the
ends
of
one
or
another
of
the
practical
interests
that
have
from
time
to
time
occupied
men's
attention
But
latterly
during
the
past
few
generations
this
learning
has
so
far
become
an
avowed
end
in
itself
that
the
increase
and
diffusion
of
knowledge
among
men
is
now
freely
rated
as
the
most
humane
and
meritorious
work
to
be
taken
care
of
by
any
enlightened
community
or
any
public-spirited
friend
of
civilization
The
expediency
of
such
increase
and
diffusion
is
no
longer
held
in
doubt
because
it
has
ceased
to
be
a
question
of
expediency
among
the
enlightened
nations
being
itself
the
consummation
upon
which
in
the
apprehension
of
civilized
men
the
advance
of
culture
must
converge
Such
has
come
to
be
the
long-term
common
sense
judgment
of
enlightened
public
opinion
A
settled
presumption
to
some
such
effect
has
found
lodgment
as
a
commonplace
conviction
in
the
popular
mind
in
much
the
same
measure
and
in
much
the
same
period
of
time
as
the
current
body
of
systematic
knowledge
has
taken
on
the
character
of
matter
of
fact
For
good
or
ill
civilized
men
have
come
to
hold
that
this
matter-of-fact
knowledge
of
things
is
the
only
end
in
life
that
indubitably
justifies
itself
So
that
nothing
more
irretrievably
shameful
could
overtake
modern
civilization
than
the
miscarriage
of
this
modern
learning
which
is
the
most
valued
spiritual
asset
of
civilized
mankind
The
truth
of
this
view
is
borne
out
by
the
professions
even
of
those
lieutenants
of
the
powers
of
darkness
who
are
straining
to
lay
waste
and
debauch
the
peoples
of
Christendom
In
high-pitched
concert
they
all
swear
by
the
name
of
a
culture
whose
sole
inalienable
asset
is
this
same
intellectual
mastery
of
matters
of
fact
At
the
same
time
it
is
only
by
drawing
on
the
resources
of
this
matter-of-fact
knowledge
that
the
protagonists
of
reaction
are
able
to
carry
on
their
campaign
of
debauchery
and
desolation
Other
interests
that
have
once
been
held
in
higher
esteem
appear
by
comparison
to
have
fallen
into
abeyance
religious
devotion
political
prestige
fighting
capacity
gentility
pecuniary
distinction
profuse
consumption
of
goods
But
it
is
only
by
comparison
with
the
higher
value
given
to
this
enterprise
of
the
intellect
that
such
other
interests
appear
to
have
lost
ground
These
and
the
like
have
fallen
into
relative
disesteem
as
being
sordid
and
insubstantial
by
comparison
Not
that
these
lower
human
interests
answering
to
the
lower
ranges
of
human
intellect
have
fallen
into
neglect
it
is
only
that
they
have
come
to
be
accounted
lower
as
contrasted
with
the
quest
of
knowledge
and
it
is
only
on
sober
second
thought
and
perhaps
only
for
the
ephemeral
present
that
they
are
so
accounted
by
the
common
run
of
civilized
mankind
Men
still
are
in
sufficiently
hot
pursuit
of
all
these
time-worn
amenities
and
each
for
himself
is
in
point
of
fact
more
than
likely
to
make
the
pursuit
of
such
self-seeking
ends
the
burden
of
his
life
but
on
a
dispassionate
rating
and
under
the
corrective
of
deliberate
avowal
it
will
appear
that
none
of
these
commend
themselves
as
intrinsically
worth
while
at
large
At
the
best
they
are
rated
as
expedient
concessions
to
human
infirmity
or
as
measures
of
defense
against
human
perversity
and
the
outrages
of
fortune
The
last
resort
of
the
apologists
for
these
more
sordid
endeavours
is
the
plea
that
only
by
this
means
can
the
ulterior
ends
of
a
civilization
of
intelligence
be
served
The
argument
may
fairly
be
paraphrased
to
the
effect
that
in
order
to
serve
God
in
the
end
we
must
all
be
ready
to
serve
the
Devil
in
the
meantime
It
is
always
possible
of
course
that
this
pre-eminence
of
intellectual
enterprise
in
the
civilization
of
the
Western
peoples
is
a
transient
episode
that
it
may
eventually
perhaps
even
precipitately
with
the
next
impending
turn
in
the
fortunes
of
this
civilization
again
be
relegated
to
a
secondary
place
in
the
scheme
of
things
and
become
only
an
instrumentality
in
the
service
of
some
dominant
aim
or
impulse
such
as
a
vainglorious
patriotism
or
dynastic
politics
or
the
breeding
of
a
commercial
aristocracy
More
than
one
of
the
nations
of
Europe
have
moved
so
far
in
this
matter
already
as
to
place
the
primacy
of
science
and
scholarship
in
doubt
as
against
warlike
ambitions
and
the
aspirations
of
the
American
community
appear
to
be
divided
between
patriotism
in
the
service
of
the
captains
of
war
and
commerce
in
the
service
of
the
captains
of
finance
But
hitherto
the
spokesmen
of
any
such
cultural
reversion
are
careful
to
declare
a
perfunctory
faith
in
that
civilization
of
disinterested
intellectual
achievement
which
they
are
endeavouring
to
suborn
to
their
several
ends
That
such
pro
forma
declarations
are
found
necessary
argues
that
the
faith
in
a
civilization
of
intelligence
is
still
so
far
intact
as
to
require
all
reactionaries
to
make
their
peace
with
it
Meantime
the
easy
matter-of-course
presumption
that
such
a
civilization
of
intelligence
justifies
itself
goes
to
argue
that
the
current
bias
which
so
comes
to
expression
will
be
the
outcome
of
a
secure
and
protracted
experience
What
underlies
and
has
brought
on
this
bent
in
the
temper
of
the
civilized
peoples
is
a
somewhat
intricate
question
of
institutional
growth
and
can
not
be
gone
into
here
but
the
gradual
shifting
of
this
matter-of-fact
outlook
into
the
primacy
among
the
ideals
of
modern
Christendom
is
sufficiently
evident
in
point
of
fact
to
any
attentive
student
of
modern
times
Conceivably
there
may
come
an
abrupt
term
to
its
paramount
vogue
through
some
precipitate
sweep
of
circumstances
but
it
did
not
come
in
by
anything
like
the
sudden
intrusion
of
a
new
invention
in
ideals
after
the
fashion
of
a
religious
conversion
nor
by
the
incursion
of
a
hitherto
alien
element
into
the
current
scheme
of
life
but
rather
by
force
of
a
gradual
and
unintended
scarcely
perceptible
shifting
of
emphasis
between
the
several
cultural
factors
that
conjointly
go
to
make
up
the
working
scheme
of
things
Along
with
this
shifting
of
matter-of-fact
knowledge
into
the
foreground
among
the
ideals
of
civilized
life
there
has
also
gone
on
a
similarly
unpremeditated
change
in
the
attitude
of
those
persons
and
establishments
that
have
to
do
with
this
learning
as
well
as
in
the
rating
accorded
them
by
the
community
at
large
Again
it
is
a
matter
of
institutional
growth
of
self-wrought
changes
in
the
scheme
of
use
and
wont
and
here
as
in
other
cases
of
institutional
growth
and
displacement
the
changes
have
gone
forward
for
the
most
part
blindly
by
impulse
without
much
foreknowledge
of
any
ulterior
consequences
to
which
such
a
sequence
of
change
might
be
said
to
tend
It
is
only
after
the
new
growth
of
use
and
wont
has
taken
effect
in
an
altered
range
of
principles
and
standards
that
its
direction
and
ulterior
consequences
can
be
appreciated
with
any
degree
of
confidence
But
this
development
that
has
thrown
up
matter-of-fact
knowledge
into
its
place
of
paramount
value
for
modern
culture
has
in
a
peculiar
degree
been
unintended
and
unforeseen
the
like
applies
to
the
case
of
the
schools
and
the
personnel
involved
and
in
a
peculiar
degree
the
drift
and
bearing
of
these
changes
have
also
not
been
appreciated
while
they
have
been
going
forward
doubtless
because
it
has
all
been
a
peculiarly
unprecedented
phenomenon
and
a
wholly
undesigned
drift
of
habituation
History
records
nothing
that
is
fairly
comparable
No
era
in
the
historic
past
has
set
a
pattern
for
guidance
in
this
matter
and
the
experience
of
none
of
the
peoples
of
history
affords
a
clue
by
which
to
have
judged
beforehand
of
the
probable
course
and
outcome
of
this
specifically
modern
and
occidental
phase
of
culture
Some
slight
beginnings
and
excursions
in
the
way
of
a
cultivation
of
matter-of-fact
learning
there
may
have
been
now
and
again
among
the
many
shifting
systems
of
esoteric
lore
that
have
claimed
attention
here
and
there
early
and
late
and
these
need
by
no
means
be
accounted
negligible
But
they
have
on
the
whole
come
to
nothing
much
better
than
broken
excursions
as
seen
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
latterday
higher
learning
and
they
have
brought
into
bearing
nothing
appreciable
in
the
way
of
establishments
designed
without
afterthought
to
further
the
advance
of
disinterested
knowledge
Anything
like
a
cultural
era
that
avowedly
takes
such
a
quest
of
knowledge
as
its
chief
and
distinctive
characteristic
is
not
known
to
history
From
this
isolated
state
of
the
case
it
follows
unfortunately
that
this
modern
phase
is
to
be
studied
only
in
its
own
light
and
since
the
sequence
of
development
has
hitherto
reached
no
secure
consummation
or
conclusion
there
is
also
much
room
for
conflicting
opinions
as
to
its
presumptive
or
legitimate
outcome
or
even
as
to
its
present
drift
II
But
notorious
facts
make
this
much
plain
that
civilized
mankind
looks
to
this
quest
of
matter-of-fact
knowledge
as
its
most
substantial
asset
and
its
most
valued
achievement
in
so
far
as
any
consensus
of
appreciation
or
of
aspirations
is
to
be
found
among
civilized
mankind
and
there
is
no
similar
consensus
bearing
on
any
other
feature
of
that
scheme
of
life
that
characterizes
modern
civilization
It
is
similarly
beyond
dispute
that
men
look
to
the
modern
system
of
schools
and
related
establishments
of
learning
for
the
furtherance
and
conservation
of
this
intellectual
enterprise
And
among
the
various
items
of
this
equipment
the
modern
university
is
by
tradition
more
closely
identified
with
the
quest
of
knowledge
than
any
other
It
stands
in
a
unique
and
peculiarly
intimate
relation
to
this
intellectual
enterprise
At
least
such
is
the
current
apprehension
of
the
university's
work
The
university
is
the
only
accepted
institution
of
the
modern
culture
on
which
the
quest
of
knowledge
unquestionably
devolves
and
the
visible
drift
of
circumstances
as
well
as
of
public
sentiment
runs
also
to
making
this
the
only
unquestioned
duty
incumbent
on
the
university
It
is
true
many
other
lines
of
work
and
of
endeavor
that
may
not
fairly
be
called
work
are
undertaken
by
schools
of
university
grade
and
also
many
other
schools
that
call
themselves
universities
will
have
substantially
nothing
to
do
with
the
higher
learning
But
each
and
several
of
these
other
lines
of
endeavor
into
which
the
universities
allow
themselves
to
be
drawn
are
open
to
question
Their
legitimacy
remains
an
open
question
in
spite
of
the
interested
arguments
of
their
spokesmen
who
advocate
the
partial
submergence
of
the
university
in
such
enterprises
as
professional
training
undergraduate
instruction
supervision
and
guidance
of
the
secondary
school
system
edification
of
the
unlearned
by
university
extension
and
similar
excursions
into
the
field
of
public
amusement
training
of
secondary
school
teachers
encouragement
of
amateurs
by
correspondence
etc
What
and
how
much
of
these
extraneous
activities
the
university
should
allow
itself
is
a
matter
on
which
there
is
no
general
agreement
even
among
those
whose
inclinations
go
far
in
that
direction
but
what
is
taken
for
granted
throughout
all
this
advocacy
of
outlying
detail
is
the
secure
premise
that
the
university
is
in
the
first
place
a
seminary
of
the
higher
learning
and
that
no
school
can
make
good
its
pretensions
to
university
standing
except
by
proving
its
fitness
in
this
respect
4
The
conservation
and
advancement
of
the
higher
learning
involves
two
lines
of
work
distinct
but
closely
bound
together
a
scientific
and
scholarly
inquiry
and
b
the
instruction
of
students
5
The
former
of
these
is
primary
and
indispensable
It
is
this
work
of
intellectual
enterprise
that
gives
its
character
to
the
university
and
marks
it
off
from
the
lower
schools
The
work
of
teaching
properly
belongs
in
the
university
only
because
and
in
so
far
as
it
incites
and
facilitates
the
university
man's
work
of
inquiry
and
the
extent
to
which
such
teaching
furthers
the
work
of
inquiry
is
scarcely
to
be
appreciated
without
a
somewhat
extended
experience
By
and
large
there
are
but
few
and
inconsequential
exceptions
to
the
rule
that
teaching
as
a
concomitant
of
investigation
is
distinctly
advantageous
to
the
investigator
particularly
in
so
far
as
his
work
is
of
the
nature
of
theoretical
inquiry
The
instruction
necessarily
involved
in
university
work
therefore
is
only
such
as
can
readily
be
combined
with
the
work
of
inquiry
at
the
same
time
that
it
goes
directly
to
further
the
higher
learning
in
that
it
trains
the
incoming
generation
of
scholars
and
scientists
for
the
further
pursuit
of
knowledge
Training
for
other
purposes
is
necessarily
of
a
different
kind
and
is
best
done
elsewhere
and
it
does
not
become
university
work
by
calling
it
so
and
imposing
its
burden
on
the
men
and
equipment
whose
only
concern
should
be
the
higher
learning
University
teaching
having
a
particular
and
special
purpose
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
it
has
also
a
particular
and
special
character
such
as
to
differentiate
it
from
other
teaching
and
at
the
same
time
leave
it
relatively
ineffective
for
other
purposes
Its
aim
is
to
equip
the
student
for
the
work
of
inquiry
not
to
give
him
facility
in
that
conduct
of
affairs
that
turns
such
knowledge
to
practical
account
Hence
the
instruction
that
falls
legitimately
under
the
hand
of
the
university
man
is
necessarily
subsidiary
and
incidental
to
the
work
of
inquiry
and
it
can
effectually
be
carried
on
only
by
such
a
teacher
as
is
himself
occupied
with
the
scrutiny
of
what
knowledge
is
already
in
hand
and
with
pushing
the
inquiry
to
further
gains
And
it
can
be
carried
on
by
such
a
teacher
only
by
drawing
his
students
into
his
own
work
of
inquiry
The
student's
relation
to
his
teacher
necessarily
becomes
that
of
an
apprentice
to
his
master
rather
than
that
of
a
pupil
to
his
schoolmaster
A
university
is
a
body
of
mature
scholars
and
scientists
the
faculty
with
whatever
plant
and
other
equipment
may
incidentally
serve
as
appliances
for
their
work
in
any
given
case
The
necessary
material
equipment
may
under
modern
conditions
be
very
considerable
as
may
also
the
number
of
care-takers
assistants
etc
but
all
that
is
not
the
university
but
merely
its
equipment
And
the
university
man's
work
is
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
together
with
whatever
advisory
surveillance
and
guidance
he
may
consistently
afford
such
students
as
are
entering
on
the
career
of
learning
at
a
point
where
his
outlook
and
methods
of
work
may
be
of
effect
for
them
No
man
whose
energies
are
not
habitually
bent
on
increasing
and
proving
up
the
domain
of
learning
belongs
legitimately
on
the
university
staff
The
university
man
is
properly
a
student
not
a
schoolmaster
Such
is
the
unmistakable
drift
of
sentiment
and
professed
endeavour
in
so
far
as
it
is
guided
by
the
cultural
aspirations
of
civilized
mankind
rather
than
by
the
emulative
strategy
of
individuals
seeking
their
own
preferment
6
All
this
of
course
implies
no
undervaluing
of
the
work
of
those
men
who
aim
to
prepare
the
youth
for
citizenship
and
a
practical
career
It
is
only
a
question
of
distinguishing
between
things
that
belong
apart
The
scientist
and
the
scholar
on
the
one
hand
and
the
schoolmaster
on
the
other
hand
both
belong
within
the
later
growth
of
civilization
but
a
differentiation
of
the
two
classes
and
a
division
of
their
work
is
indispensable
if
they
are
to
do
their
work
as
it
should
be
done
and
as
the
modern
community
thoughtfully
intends
that
it
should
be
done
And
while
such
a
division
of
labour
has
hitherto
not
been
carried
through
with
any
degree
of
consistency
it
is
at
least
under
way
and
there
is
nothing
but
the
presumption
of
outworn
usage
that
continues
to
hold
the
two
lines
of
work
together
to
the
detriment
of
both
backed
it
is
true
by
ambitions
of
self-aggrandizement
on
the
part
of
many
schools
and
many
of
their
directorates
The
schoolmaster
and
his
work
may
be
equally
or
more
valuable
to
the
community
at
large
presumably
more
rather
than
less
but
in
so
far
as
his
chief
interest
is
of
the
pedagogical
sort
his
place
is
not
in
the
university
Exposition
instruction
and
drill
belong
in
and
professional
schools
The
consistent
aim
there
is
and
should
be
to
instruct
to
inculcate
a
knowledge
of
results
and
to
give
the
pupil
a
working
facility
in
applying
it
On
the
university
level
such
information
and
training
is
should
be
incidental
to
the
work
of
research
The
university
man
is
almost
unavoidably
a
teacher
by
precept
and
example
but
he
can
not
without
detriment
to
his
work
as
scientist
or
scholar
serve
as
a
taskmaster
or
a
vehicle
of
indoctrination
The
student
who
comes
up
to
the
university
for
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
is
expected
to
know
what
he
wants
and
to
want
it
without
compulsion
If
he
falls
short
in
these
respects
if
he
has
not
the
requisite
interest
and
initiative
it
is
his
own
misfortune
not
the
fault
of
his
teacher
What
he
has
a
legitimate
claim
to
is
an
opportunity
for
such
personal
contact
and
guidance
as
will
give
him
familiarity
with
the
ways
and
means
of
the
higher
learning
any
information
imparted
to
him
being
incidental
to
this
main
work
of
habituation
He
gets
a
chance
to
make
himself
a
scholar
and
what
he
will
do
with
his
opportunities
in
this
way
lies
in
his
own
discretion
The
difference
between
the
modern
university
and
the
lower
and
professional
schools
is
broad
and
simple
not
so
much
a
difference
of
degree
as
of
kind
There
is
no
difficulty
about
apprehending
or
appreciating
this
difference
the
dispute
turns
not
on
the
practicability
of
distinguishing
between
the
two
but
on
the
desirability
of
letting
such
a
distinction
go
into
effect
It
is
a
controversy
between
those
who
wish
to
hold
fast
that
which
once
was
good
and
those
who
look
to
make
use
of
the
means
in
hand
for
new
ends
and
meet
new
exigencies
The
lower
schools
including
the
professional
schools
are
in
the
ideal
scheme
designed
to
fit
the
incoming
generation
for
civil
life
they
are
therefore
occupied
with
instilling
such
knowledge
and
habits
as
will
make
their
pupils
fit
citizens
of
the
world
in
whatever
position
in
the
fabric
of
workday
life
they
may
fall
The
university
on
the
other
hand
is
specialized
to
fit
men
for
a
life
of
science
and
scholarship
and
it
is
accordingly
concerned
with
such
discipline
only
as
will
give
efficiency
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
and
fit
its
students
for
the
increase
and
diffusion
of
learning
It
follows
that
while
the
lower
schools
necessarily
take
over
the
surveillance
of
their
pupils
everyday
life
and
exercise
a
large
measure
of
authority
and
responsible
interference
in
that
behalf
the
university
assumes
or
should
assume
no
responsibility
for
its
students
fortunes
in
the
moral
religious
pecuniary
domestic
or
hygienic
respect
Doubtless
the
larger
and
more
serious
responsibility
in
the
educational
system
belongs
not
to
the
university
but
to
the
lower
and
professional
schools
Citizenship
is
a
larger
and
more
substantial
category
than
scholarship
and
the
furtherance
of
civilized
life
is
a
larger
and
more
serious
interest
than
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
for
its
own
idle
sake
But
the
proportions
which
the
quest
of
knowledge
is
latterly
assuming
in
scheme
of
civilized
life
require
that
the
establishments
the
to
which
this
interest
is
committed
should
not
be
charged
with
extraneous
duties
particularly
not
with
extraneous
matters
themselves
of
such
grave
consequence
as
this
training
for
citizenship
and
practical
affairs
These
are
too
serious
a
range
of
duties
to
be
taken
care
of
as
a
side-issue
by
a
seminary
of
learning
the
members
of
whose
faculty
if
they
are
fit
for
their
own
special
work
are
not
men
of
affairs
or
adepts
in
worldly
wisdom
III
In
point
of
historical
pedigree
the
American
universities
are
of
another
derivation
than
their
European
counterpart
although
the
difference
in
this
respect
is
not
so
sharp
a
matter
of
contrast
as
might
be
assumed
at
first
sight
The
European
Continental
universities
appear
to
have
been
founded
originally
to
meet
the
needs
of
professional
training
more
particularly
theological
and
philosophical
training
in
the
earlier
times
The
American
universities
are
historically
an
outgrowth
of
the
American
college
and
the
latter
was
installed
in
its
beginnings
largely
as
a
means
of
professional
training
chiefly
training
for
Divinity
secondarily
for
the
calling
of
the
schoolmaster
But
in
neither
case
neither
in
that
of
the
European
university
nor
in
that
of
the
American
College
was
this
early
vocational
aim
of
the
schools
allowed
to
decide
their
character
in
the
long
run
nor
to
circumscribe
the
lines
of
their
later
growth
In
both
cases
somewhat
alike
the
two
groups
of
schools
came
to
their
mature
development
in
the
nineteenth
century
as
establishments
occupied
with
disinterested
learning
given
over
to
the
pursuit
of
intellectual
enterprise
rather
than
as
seminaries
for
training
of
a
vocational
kind
They
still
had
a
vocational
value
no
doubt
and
the
vocational
needs
of
their
students
need
not
have
been
absent
from
the
considerations
that
guided
their
directorates
It
would
particularly
be
found
that
the
clerical
directorates
of
the
American
colleges
had
more
than
half
an
eye
to
the
needs
of
Divinity
even
at
so
late
a
date
as
when
in
the
third
quarter
of
the
century
the
complexion
of
the
American
college
situation
began
seriously
to
change
It
is
from
this
period
from
the
era
of
the
Civil
War
and
the
Reconstruction
that
the
changes
set
in
which
have
reshaped
the
academic
situation
in
America
At
this
era
some
half
a
century
ago
the
American
college
was
or
was
at
least
pressed
to
be
given
over
to
disinterested
instruction
not
specialized
with
a
vocational
or
even
a
denominational
bias
It
was
coming
to
take
its
place
as
the
superior
or
crowning
member
a
sort
of
capstone
of
the
system
of
public
instruction
The
life
history
of
any
one
of
the
state
universities
whose
early
period
of
growth
runs
across
this
era
will
readily
show
the
effectual
guidance
of
such
an
ideal
of
a
college
as
a
superior
and
definitive
member
in
a
school
system
designed
to
afford
an
extended
course
of
instruction
looking
to
an
unbiassed
increase
and
diffusion
of
knowledge
Other
interests
of
a
professional
or
vocational
kind
were
also
entrusted
to
the
keeping
of
these
new-found
schools
but
with
a
conclusive
generality
the
rule
holds
that
in
these
academic
creations
a
college
establishment
of
a
disinterested
non-vocational
character
is
counted
in
as
the
indispensable
nucleus
that
much
was
at
that
time
a
matter
of
course
The
further
development
shows
two
marked
features
The
American
university
has
come
into
bearing
and
the
college
has
become
an
intermediate
rather
than
a
terminal
link
in
the
conventional
scheme
of
education
Under
the
names
undergraduate
and
graduate
the
college
and
the
university
are
still
commonly
coupled
together
as
subdivisions
of
a
complex
whole
but
this
holding
together
of
the
two
disparate
schools
is
at
the
best
a
freak
of
aimless
survival
At
the
worst
and
more
commonly
it
is
the
result
of
a
gross
ambition
for
magnitude
on
the
part
of
the
joint
directorate
Whether
the
college
lives
by
itself
as
an
independent
establishment
on
a
foundation
of
its
own
or
is
in
point
of
legal
formality
a
subdivision
of
the
university
establishment
it
takes
its
place
in
the
educational
scheme
as
senior
member
of
the
secondary
school
system
and
it
bears
no
peculiarly
close
relation
to
the
university
as
a
seat
of
learning
At
the
closest
it
stands
to
the
university
in
the
relation
of
a
fitting
school
more
commonly
its
relations
are
closer
with
the
ordinary
professional
and
vocational
schools
and
for
the
most
part
it
stands
in
no
relation
beyond
that
of
juxtaposition
with
the
one
or
the
other
The
attempt
to
hold
the
college
and
the
no
means
together
in
bonds
of
ostensible
Solidarity
is
by
university
an
advisedly
concerted
adjustment
to
the
needs
of
scholarship
as
they
run
today
By
historical
accident
the
older
American
universities
have
grown
into
bearing
on
the
ground
of
an
underlying
college
and
the
external
connection
so
inherited
has
not
usually
been
severed
and
by
ill-advised
or
perhaps
unadvised
imitation
the
younger
universities
have
blundered
into
encumbering
themselves
with
an
undergraduate
department
to
simulate
this
presumptively
honourable
pedigree
to
the
detriment
both
of
the
university
and
of
the
college
so
bound
up
with
it
By
this
arrangement
the
college
undergraduate
department
falls
into
the
position
of
an
appendage
a
side
issue
to
be
taken
care
of
by
afterthought
on
the
part
of
a
body
of
men
whose
chief
legitimate
interest
runs
should
run
on
other
things
than
the
efficient
management
of
such
an
undergraduate
training-school
provided
always
that
they
are
a
bona
fide
university
faculty
and
not
a
body
of
secondary-school
teachers
masquerading
under
the
assumed
name
of
a
university
The
motive
to
this
inclusion
of
an
undergraduate
department
in
the
newer
universities
appears
commonly
to
have
been
a
headlong
eagerness
on
the
part
of
the
corporate
authorities
to
show
a
complete
establishment
of
the
conventionally
accepted
pattern
and
to
enroll
as
many
students
as
possible
Whatever
may
have
been
true
for
the
earlier
time
when
the
American
college
first
grew
up
and
flourished
it
is
beyond
question
that
the
undergraduate
department
which
takes
the
place
of
the
college
today
cannot
be
rated
as
an
institution
of
the
higher
learning
At
the
best
it
is
now
a
school
for
preliminary
training
preparatory
to
entering
on
the
career
of
learning
or
in
preparation
for
the
further
training
required
for
the
professions
but
it
is
also
and
chiefly
an
establishment
designed
to
give
the
concluding
touches
to
the
education
of
young
men
who
have
no
designs
on
learning
beyond
the
close
of
the
college
curriculum
It
aims
to
afford
a
rounded
discipline
to
those
whose
goal
is
the
life
of
fashion
or
of
affairs
How
well
or
how
ill
the
college
may
combine
these
two
unrelated
purposes
is
a
question
that
does
not
immediately
concern
the
present
inquiry
It
is
touched
on
here
only
to
point
the
contrast
between
the
American
college
and
the
university
It
follows
from
the
character
of
their
work
that
while
the
university
should
offer
no
set
curriculum
the
college
has
properly
nothing
else
to
offer
But
the
retention
or
inclusion
of
the
college
and
its
aims
within
the
university
corporation
has
necessarily
led
to
the
retention
of
college
standards
and
methods
of
control
even
in
what
is
or
purports
to
be
university
work
so
that
it
is
by
no
means
unusual
to
find
university
graduate
work
scheduled
in
the
form
of
a
curriculum
with
all
that
boarding-school
circumstance
and
apparatus
that
is
so
unavoidable
an
evil
in
all
undergraduate
training
In
effect
the
outcome
of
these
short-sighted
attempts
to
take
care
of
the
higher
learning
by
the
means
and
method
of
the
boys
school
commonly
is
to
eliminate
the
higher
learning
from
the
case
and
substitute
the
aims
and
results
of
a
boys
training-school
Undergraduate
work
being
task
work
it
is
possible
without
fatal
effect
to
reduce
it
to
standard
units
of
time
and
volume
and
so
control
and
enforce
it
by
a
system
of
accountancy
and
surveillance
the
methods
of
control
accountancy
and
coercion
that
so
come
to
be
worked
out
have
all
that
convincing
appearance
of
tangible
efficiency
that
belongs
to
any
mechanically
defined
and
statistically
accountable
routine
such
as
will
always
commend
itself
to
the
spirit
of
the
schoolmaster
the
temptation
to
apply
such
methods
of
standardized
routine
wherever
it
is
at
all
feasible
is
always
present
and
it
is
cogently
spoken
for
by
all
those
to
whom
drill
is
a
more
intelligible
conception
than
scholarship
The
work
of
learning
which
distinctively
belongs
in
the
university
on
the
other
hand
is
a
matter
of
personal
contact
and
co-operation
between
teacher
and
student
and
is
not
measurable
in
statistical
units
or
amenable
to
mechanical
tests
the
men
engaged
in
this
work
can
accordingly
offer
nothing
of
the
same
definite
character
in
place
of
the
rigid
routine
and
accountancy
advocated
by
the
schoolmasters
and
the
outcome
in
nearly
all
cases
where
the
control
of
both
departments
vests
in
one
composite
corporate
body
as
it
usually
does
is
the
gradual
insinuation
of
undergraduate
methods
and
standards
in
the
graduate
school
until
what
is
nominally
university
work
settles
down
in
effect
into
nothing
more
than
an
extension
of
the
undergraduate
curriculum
This
effect
is
had
partly
by
reducing
such
of
the
graduate
courses
as
are
found
amenable
to
the
formalities
of
the
undergraduate
routine
and
partly
by
dispensing
with
such
graduate
work
as
will
not
lend
itself
even
ostensibly
to
the
schoolmaster's
methods
What
has
been
said
of
the
college
in
this
connection
holds
true
in
the
main
also
of
the
professional
and
technical
schools
In
their
aims
methods
and
achievements
these
schools
are
in
the
nature
of
the
case
foreign
to
the
higher
learning
This
is
of
course
not
said
in
disparagement
of
their
work
rather
the
contrary
As
is
the
case
with
the
college
so
these
schools
also
are
often
included
in
the
university
corporation
by
ties
of
an
external
and
factitious
kind
frequently
by
terms
of
the
charter
But
this
formal
inclusion
of
them
under
the
corporate
charter
does
not
set
aside
the
substantial
discrepancy
between
their
purpose
work
and
animus
and
those
of
the
university
proper
It
can
only
serve
to
trouble
the
single-mindedness
of
both
It
leaves
both
the
pursuit
of
learning
and
the
work
of
preparation
for
the
professions
somewhat
at
loose
ends
confused
with
the
bootless
illusion
that
they
are
in
some
recondite
way
parallel
variants
of
a
single
line
of
work
In
aim
and
animus
the
technical
and
professional
schools
are
practical
in
the
most
thorough
going
manner
while
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
that
occupies
the
scientists
and
scholars
is
not
practical
in
the
slightest
degree
The
divergent
lines
of
interest
to
be
taken
care
of
by
the
professional
schools
and
the
university
respectively
are
as
widely
out
of
touch
as
may
well
be
within
the
general
field
of
human
knowledge
The
one
is
animated
wholly
by
considerations
of
material
expediency
and
the
range
of
its
interest
and
efforts
is
strictly
limited
by
consideration
of
the
useful
effect
to
which
the
proficiency
that
it
gives
is
to
be
turned
the
other
knows
nothing
of
expediency
and
is
influenced
by
no
consideration
of
utility
or
disutility
in
its
appreciation
of
the
knowledge
to
be
sought
The
animus
of
the
one
is
worldly
wisdom
of
the
other
idle
curiosity
The
two
are
incommensurably
at
variance
so
far
as
regards
their
purpose
and
in
great
measure
also
as
regards
their
methods
of
work
and
necessarily
so
But
with
all
this
divergence
of
purpose
and
animus
there
is
after
all
a
broad
and
very
substantial
bond
of
community
between
the
technical
schools
on
the
one
hand
and
the
proper
work
of
the
university
on
the
other
hand
in
that
the
two
are
in
great
measure
occupied
with
the
same
general
range
of
materials
and
employ
somewhat
the
same
logical
methods
in
handling
these
materials
But
the
relation
that
results
from
this
community
of
material
is
almost
wholly
external
and
mechanical
Nor
does
it
set
up
any
presumption
that
the
two
should
expediently
be
included
in
the
same
corporate
establishment
or
even
that
they
need
be
near
neighbors
or
need
maintain
peculiarly
close
relations
of
personnel
The
technical
schools
and
in
a
less
degree
the
professional
schools
not
properly
classed
as
technical
depend
in
large
measure
on
results
worked
out
by
the
scientists
who
properly
belong
in
the
universities
But
the
material
so
made
use
of
for
technical
ends
are
taken
over
and
turned
to
account
without
afterthought
The
technologist's
work
is
related
to
that
of
the
scientists
very
much
as
the
work
of
the
designer
is
related
to
that
of
the
inventor
To
a
considerable
extent
the
scientists
similarly
depend
on
the
work
of
the
technical
men
for
information
and
for
correction
and
verification
of
their
own
theoretical
work
But
there
is
on
this
account
nothing
to
gain
by
associating
any
given
technical
school
with
any
given
university
establishment
incorporation
in
any
given
university
does
not
in
any
degree
facilitate
the
utilization
of
the
results
of
the
sciences
by
the
technical
men
nor
is
it
found
in
practice
to
further
the
work
of
the
sciences
The
schools
in
question
do
not
in
any
peculiar
degree
draw
on
the
work
of
the
scientists
attached
to
their
particular
university
nor
do
these
scientists
on
the
other
hand
have
any
special
use
for
the
work
of
their
associated
technical
schools
In
either
case
the
source
drawn
on
is
the
general
literature
of
the
subject
the
body
of
materials
available
at
large
not
the
work
of
particular
men
attached
to
particular
schools
The
generalizations
of
science
are
indispensable
to
the
technical
men
but
what
they
draw
on
is
the
body
of
science
at
large
regardless
of
what
any
given
university
establishment
may
have
had
to
do
with
the
work
out
of
which
the
particular
items
of
scientific
information
have
emerged
Nor
is
this
scientific
material
useful
to
the
technologists
for
the
further
pursuit
of
science
to
them
the
scientific
results
are
data
raw
material
to
be
turned
to
practical
use
not
means
by
which
to
carry
scientific
inquiry
out
to
further
results
Similarly
the
professions
and
the
technical
schools
afford
valuable
data
for
the
use
of
the
professed
scholars
and
scientists
information
that
serves
as
material
of
Investigation
or
that
will
at
least
be
useful
as
a
means
of
extending
correcting
verifying
and
correlating
lines
of
inquiry
on
which
they
are
engaged
But
the
further
bearing
of
these
facts
upon
the
affairs
of
life
their
expediency
or
futility
is
of
no
interest
or
consequence
The
affairs
of
life
except
the
affairs
of
learning
do
not
touch
the
interest
of
the
university
man
as
a
scholar
or
scientist
What
is
of
importance
to
him
in
all
these
matters
with
which
the
professions
and
technologists
are
busy
is
their
bearing
on
those
matters
of
fact
into
which
his
scientific
interest
leads
him
to
inquire
The
tests
and
experiments
carried
out
at
these
technical
schools
as
well
as
the
experience
gathered
by
the
members
of
their
staff
will
occasionally
afford
him
material
for
further
inquiry
or
means
whereby
to
check
results
already
arrived
at
but
for
such
material
he
does
not
by
preference
resort
to
any
one
of
the
technical
schools
as
contrasted
with
any
other
and
it
is
quite
an
idle
question
whether
the
source
of
any
such
serviceable
information
is
a
school
attached
to
his
own
university
The
investigator
finds
his
material
where
he
can
which
comes
to
saying
that
he
draws
on
the
general
body
of
technical
knowledge
with
no
afterthought
as
to
what
particular
technical
school
may
have
stood
in
some
relation
or
other
to
the
information
which
he
finds
useful
Neither
to
the
man
engaged
in
university
work
nor
to
the
technical
schools
that
may
serve
him
as
occasional
sources
of
material
is
there
any
advantage
to
be
derived
from
their
inclusion
in
the
university
establishment
Indeed
it
is
a
detriment
to
both
parties
as
has
already
been
remarked
but
more
decidedly
to
the
university
men
By
including
the
technical
and
professional
schools
in
the
university
corporation
the
technologists
and
professional
men
attached
to
these
schools
are
necessarily
included
among
the
academic
staff
and
so
they
come
to
take
their
part
in
the
direction
of
academic
affairs
at
large
In
what
they
so
do
toward
shaping
the
academic
policy
they
will
not
only
count
for
all
they
are
worth
but
they
are
likely
to
count
for
something
more
than
their
due
share
in
this
respect
for
they
are
to
some
extent
trained
to
the
conduct
of
affairs
and
so
come
in
for
something
of
that
deference
that
is
currently
paid
to
men
of
affairs
at
the
same
time
that
this
practical
training
gives
them
an
advantage
over
their
purely
academic
colleagues
in
the
greater
assurance
and
adroitness
with
which
they
are
able
to
present
their
contentions
By
virtue
of
this
same
training
as
well
as
by
force
of
current
practical
interest
the
technologist
and
the
professional
man
are
like
other
men
of
affairs
necessarily
and
habitually
impatient
of
any
scientific
or
scholarly
work
that
does
not
obviously
lend
itself
to
some
practical
use
The
technologist
appreciates
what
is
mechanically
serviceable
the
professional
man
as
for
instance
the
lawyer
appreciates
what
promises
pecuniary
gain
and
the
two
unite
with
the
business-man
at
large
in
repudiating
whatever
does
not
look
directly
to
such
a
utilitarian
outcome
So
that
as
members
of
the
academic
staff
these
men
are
likely
to
count
at
their
full
weight
toward
the
diversion
of
the
university's
forces
from
disinterested
science
and
scholarship
to
such
palpably
utilitarian
ends
But
the
active
measures
so
taken
by
the
academic
authorities
at
the
instance
of
the
schoolmasters
and
practical
men
are
by
no
means
the
only
line
along
which
their
presence
in
the
academic
corporation
affects
the
case
Intimate
association
with
these
utilitarians
unavoidably
has
its
corrupting
effect
on
the
scientists
and
scholars
and
induces
in
them
also
something
of
the
same
bias
toward
practical
results
in
their
work
so
that
they
no
longer
pursue
the
higher
learning
with
undivided
interest
but
with
more
or
less
of
an
eye
to
the
utilitarian
main
chance
whereby
the
advantages
of
specialization
which
are
the
reason
for
these
schools
are
lost
and
the
pride
of
the
modern
community
is
wounded
in
its
most
sensitive
spot
the
efficiency
of
its
specialists
So
also
on
the
other
hand
the
formal
incorporation
of
these
technological
and
professional
men
in
the
academic
body
with
its
professedly
single-minded
interest
in
learning
has
its
effect
on
their
frame
of
mind
They
are
without
intending
it
placed
in
a
false
position
which
unavoidably
leads
them
to
court
a
specious
appearance
of
scholarship
and
so
to
invest
their
technological
discipline
with
a
degree
of
pedantry
and
sophistication
whereby
it
is
hoped
to
give
these
schools
and
their
work
some
scientific
and
scholarly
prestige
and
so
lift
it
to
that
dignity
that
is
pressed
to
attach
to
a
non-utilitarian
pursuit
of
learning
Doubtless
this
pursuit
of
scholarly
prestige
is
commonly
successful
to
the
extent
that
it
produces
the
desired
conviction
of
awe
in
the
vulgar
who
do
not
know
the
difference
but
all
this
make-believe
scholarship
however
successfully
staged
is
not
what
these
schools
are
designed
for
or
at
least
it
is
not
what
is
expected
of
them
nor
is
it
what
they
can
do
best
and
most
efficiently
To
the
substantial
gain
of
both
parties
though
with
some
lesion
of
the
vanity
of
both
the
separation
between
the
university
and
the
professional
and
technical
schools
should
be
carried
through
and
made
absolute
Only
on
such
conditions
can
either
the
one
or
the
other
do
its
own
work
in
a
workmanlike
manner
Within
the
university
precincts
any
aim
or
interest
other
than
those
of
irresponsible
science
and
scholarship
pursuit
of
matter-of-fact
knowledge
are
to
be
rated
as
interlopers
IV
To
all
this
there
is
the
ready
objection
of
the
schoolmasters
and
utilitarians
that
such
a
project
is
fantastic
and
unpractical
useless
and
undesirable
that
such
has
not
been
the
mission
of
the
university
in
the
past
nor
its
accepted
place
and
use
in
the
educational
system
of
today
and
yesterday
that
the
universities
of
Christendom
have
from
their
first
foundation
been
occupied
with
professional
training
and
useful
knowledge
that
they
have
been
founded
for
utilitarian
purposes
and
their
work
has
been
guided
mainly
or
altogether
by
utilitarian
considerations
all
of
which
is
conceded
without
argument
The
historical
argument
amounts
to
saying
that
the
universities
were
founded
before
modern
civilization
took
on
its
modern
character
before
the
disinterested
pursuit
of
knowledge
had
come
to
take
the
first
place
among
the
ideals
of
civilized
mankind
and
that
they
were
established
to
take
care
of
those
interests
which
were
then
accounted
of
first
importance
and
that
this
intellectual
enterprise
in
pursuit
of
disinterested
knowledge
consequently
was
not
at
that
time
confided
to
the
care
of
any
special
establishment
or
freely
avowed
as
a
legitimate
interest
in
its
own
right
It
is
true
that
by
historical
accident
the
university
at
large
has
grown
out
of
professional
training-schools
primarily
schools
for
training
in
theology
secondarily
in
law
and
medicine
It
is
also
true
in
like
wise
and
in
like
degree
that
modern
science
and
scholarship
have
grown
out
of
the
technology
of
handicraft
and
the
theological
philosophy
of
the
schoolmen
7
But
just
as
it
would
be
a
bootless
enterprise
to
cut
modern
science
back
into
handicraft
technology
so
would
it
be
a
gratuitous
imbecility
to
prune
back
the
modern
university
to
that
inchoate
phase
of
its
life-history
and
make
it
again
a
corporation
for
the
training
of
theologians
jurists
and
doctors
of
medicine
The
historical
argument
does
not
enjoin
a
return
to
the
beginning
of
things
but
rather
an
intelligent
appreciation
of
what
things
are
coming
to
The
genesis
of
the
university
at
large
taken
as
an
institution
of
civilized
life
is
an
incident
of
the
transition
from
the
barbarian
culture
of
the
middle
ages
to
modern
times
and
its
later
growth
and
acquirement
of
character
is
an
incident
of
the
further
growth
of
modern
civilization
and
the
character
of
this
later
growth
of
the
university
reflects
the
bent
of
modern
civilization
as
contrasted
with
the
barbarian
spirit
of
things
in
the
mediaeval
spiritual
world
In
a
general
way
the
place
of
the
university
in
the
culture
of
Christendom
is
still
substantially
the
same
as
it
has
been
from
the
beginning
Ideally
and
in
the
popular
apprehension
it
is
as
it
has
always
been
a
corporation
for
the
cultivation
and
care
of
the
community's
highest
aspirations
and
ideals
But
these
ideals
and
aspirations
have
changed
somewhat
with
the
changing
scheme
of
the
Western
civilization
and
so
the
university
has
also
concomitantly
so
changed
in
character
aims
and
ideals
as
to
leave
it
still
the
corporate
organ
of
the
community's
dominant
intellectual
interest
At
the
same
time
it
is
true
these
changes
in
the
purpose
and
spirit
of
the
university
have
always
been
and
are
always
being
made
only
tardily
reluctantly
concessively
against
the
protests
of
those
who
are
zealous
for
the
commonplaces
of
the
day
before
yesterday
Such
is
the
character
of
institutional
growth
and
change
and
in
its
adaptation
to
the
altered
requirements
of
an
altered
scheme
of
culture
the
university
has
in
this
matter
been
subject
to
the
conditions
of
institutional
growth
at
large
An
institution
is
after
all
a
prevalent
habit
of
thought
and
as
such
it
is
subject
to
the
conditions
and
limitations
that
surround
any
change
in
the
habitual
frame
of
mind
prevalent
in
the
community
The
university
of
medieval
and
early
modern
times
that
is
to
say
the
barbarian
university
was
necessarily
given
over
to
the
pragmatic
utilitarian
disciplines
since
that
is
the
nature
of
barbarism
and
the
barbarian
university
is
but
another
somewhat
sublimated
expression
of
the
same
barbarian
frame
of
mind
The
barbarian
culture
is
pragmatic
utilitarian
worldly
wise
and
its
learning
partakes
of
the
same
complexion
The
barbarian
late
or
early
is
typically
an
unmitigated
pragmatist
that
is
the
spiritual
trait
that
most
profoundly
marks
him
off
from
the
savage
on
the
one
hand
and
from
the
civilized
man
on
the
other
hand
He
turns
a
keen
untroubled
face
home
to
the
instant
need
of
things
The
high
era
of
barbarism
in
Europe
the
Dark
and
Middle
Ages
is
marked
off
from
what
went
before
and
from
what
has
followed
in
the
cultural
sequence
by
a
hard
and
fast
utilitarian
animus
The
all-dominating
spiritual
trait
of
those
times
is
that
men
then
made
the
means
of
life
its
end
It
is
perhaps
needless
to
call
to
mind
that
much
of
this
animus
still
survives
in
later
civilized
life
especially
in
so
far
as
the
scheme
of
civilized
life
is
embodied
in
the
competitive
system
In
that
earlier
time
practical
sagacity
and
the
serviceability
of
any
knowledge
acquired
its
bearing
on
individual
advantage
spiritual
or
temporal
was
the
ruling
consideration
as
never
before
or
since
The
best
of
men
in
that
world
were
not
ashamed
to
avow
that
a
boundless
solicitude
for
their
own
salvation
was
their
worthiest
motive
of
conduct
and
it
is
plain
in
all
their
speculations
that
they
were
unable
to
accept
any
other
motive
or
sanction
as
final
in
any
bearing
Saint
and
sinner
alike
knew
no
higher
rule
than
expediency
for
this
world
and
the
next
And
for
that
matter
so
it
still
stands
with
the
saint
and
the
sinner
who
make
up
much
of
the
commonplace
human
material
in
the
modern
community
although
both
the
saint
and
the
sinner
in
the
modern
community
carry
largely
by
shamefaced
subreption
an
ever
increasing
side-line
of
other
and
more
genial
interests
that
have
no
merit
in
point
of
expediency
whether
for
this
world
or
the
next
Under
the
rule
of
such
a
cultural
ideal
the
corporation
of
learning
could
not
well
take
any
avowed
stand
except
as
an
establishment
for
utilitarian
instruction
the
practical
expediency
of
whose
work
was
the
sole
overt
test
of
its
competency
And
such
it
still
should
continue
to
be
according
to
the
avowed
aspirations
of
the
staler
commonplace
elements
in
the
community
today
By
subreption
and
by
a
sophisticated
subsumption
under
some
ostensibly
practical
line
of
interest
and
inquiry
it
is
true
the
university
men
of
the
earlier
time
spent
much
of
their
best
endeavour
on
matters
of
disinterested
scholarship
that
had
no
bearing
on
any
human
want
more
to
the
point
than
an
idle
curiosity
and
by
a
similar
turn
of
subreption
and
sophistication
the
later
spokesmen
of
the
barbarian
ideal
take
much
complacent
credit
for
the
triumphs
of
modern
science
that
have
nothing
but
an
ostensible
bearing
on
any
matter
of
practical
expediency
and
they
look
to
the
universities
to
continue
this
work
of
the
idle
curiosity
under
some
plausible
pretext
of
practicality
So
the
university
of
that
era
unavoidably
came
to
be
organized
as
a
more
or
less
comprehensive
federation
of
professional
schools
or
faculties
devoted
to
such
branches
of
practical
knowledge
as
the
ruling
utilitarian
interests
of
the
time
demanded
Under
this
overshadowing
barbarian
tradition
the
universities
of
early
modern
times
started
out
as
an
avowed
contrivance
for
indoctrination
in
the
ways
and
means
of
salvation
spiritual
and
temporal
individual
and
collective
in
some
sort
a
school
of
engineering
primarily
in
divinity
secondarily
in
law
and
politics
and
presently
in
medicine
and
also
in
the
other
professions
that
serve
a
recognized
utilitarian
interest
After
that
fashion
of
a
university
that
answered
to
this
manner
of
ideals
and
aspirations
had
once
been
installed
and
gained
a
secure
footing
its
pattern
acquired
a
degree
of
authenticity
and
prescription
so
that
later
seminaries
of
learning
came
unquestioningly
to
be
organized
on
the
same
lines
and
further
changes
of
academic
policy
and
practice
such
as
are
demanded
by
the
later
growth
of
cultural
interests
and
ideals
have
been
made
only
reluctantly
and
with
a
suspicious
reserve
gradually
and
by
a
circuitous
sophistication
so
that
much
of
the
non-utilitarian
scientific
and
scholarly
work
indispensable
to
the
university's
survival
under
modern
conditions
is
still
scheduled
under
the
faculties
of
law
or
medicine
or
even
of
divinity
But
the
human
propensity
for
inquiry
into
things
irrespective
of
use
or
expediency
insinuated
itself
among
the
expositors
of
worldly
wisdom
from
the
outset
and
from
the
first
this
quest
of
idle
learning
has
sought
shelter
in
the
university
as
the
only
establishment
in
which
it
could
find
a
domicile
even
on
sufferance
and
so
could
achieve
that
footing
of
consecutive
intellectual
enterprise
running
through
successive
generations
of
scholars
which
is
above
all
else
indispensable
to
the
advancement
of
knowledge
Under
the
rgime
of
unmitigated
pragmatic
aims
that
ruled
the
earlier
days
of
the
European
universities
this
pursuit
of
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
was
carried
on
as
a
work
of
scholarly
supererogation
by
men
whose
ostensibly
sole
occupation
was
the
promulgation
of
some
accredited
line
of
salutary
information
Frequently
it
had
to
be
carried
on
under
some
colourable
masquerade
of
practicality
And
yet
so
persistent
has
the
spirit
of
idle
curiosity
proved
to
be
and
so
consonant
with
the
long-term
demands
even
of
the
laity
that
the
dissimulation
and
smuggling-in
of
disinterested
learning
has
gone
on
ever
more
openly
and
at
an
ever
increasing
rate
of
gain
until
in
the
end
the
attention
given
to
scholarship
and
the
non-utilitarian
sciences
in
these
establishments
has
come
far
to
exceed
that
given
to
the
practical
disciplines
for
which
the
several
faculties
were
originally
installed
As
time
has
passed
and
as
successive
cultural
mutations
have
passed
over
the
community
shifting
the
centre
of
interest
and
bringing
new
ideals
of
scholarship
and
bringing
the
whole
cultural
fabric
nearer
to
its
modern
complexion
those
purposes
of
crass
expediency
that
were
of
such
great
moment
and
were
so
much
a
matter
of
course
in
earlier
academic
policy
have
insensibly
fallen
to
the
rank
of
incidentals
And
what
had
once
been
incidental
or
even
an
object
of
surreptitious
tolerance
in
the
university
remains
today
as
the
only
unequivocal
duty
of
the
corporation
of
learning
and
stands
out
as
the
one
characteristic
trait
without
which
no
establishment
can
claim
rank
as
a
university
Philosophy
the
avowed
body
of
theoretical
science
in
the
late
medieval
time
had
grown
out
of
the
schoolmen's
speculations
in
theology
being
in
point
of
derivation
a
body
of
refinements
on
the
divine
scheme
of
salvation
and
with
a
view
to
quiet
title
and
to
make
manifest
their
devotion
to
the
greater
good
of
eschatological
expediency
those
ingenious
speculators
were
content
to
proclaim
that
their
philosophy
is
the
handmaid
of
theology
Philosophia
theologiae
ancillans
But
their
philosophy
has
fallen
into
the
alembic
of
the
idle
curiosity
and
has
given
rise
to
a
body
of
modern
science
godless
and
unpractical
that
has
no
intended
or
even
ostensible
bearing
on
the
religious
fortunes
of
mankind
and
their
sanctimonious
maxim
would
today
be
better
accepted
as
the
subject
of
a
limerick
than
of
a
homily
Except
in
degree
the
fortunes
of
the
temporal
pragmatic
disciplines
in
Law
and
Medicine
have
been
much
the
same
as
that
of
their
elder
sister
Theology
Professionalism
and
practical
serviceability
have
been
gradually
crowded
into
the
background
of
academic
interests
and
overlaid
with
quasi-utilitarian
research
such
as
the
history
of
jurisprudence
comparative
physiology
and
the
like
They
have
in
fact
largely
been
eliminated
8
And
changes
running
to
this
effect
have
gone
farthest
and
have
taken
most
consistent
effect
in
those
communities
that
are
most
fully
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
the
modern
peaceable
civilization
It
is
in
the
more
backward
communities
and
schools
that
the
barbarian
animus
of
utilitarianism
still
maintains
itself
most
nearly
intact
whether
it
touches
matters
of
temporal
or
of
spiritual
interest
With
the
later
advance
of
culture
as
the
intellectual
interest
has
gradually
displaced
the
older
ideals
in
men's
esteem
and
barring
a
reactionary
episode
here
and
there
the
university
has
progressively
come
to
take
its
place
as
a
seat
of
the
higher
learning
a
corporation
for
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
and
barring
accidental
reversions
it
has
increasingly
asserted
itself
as
an
imperative
necessity
more
and
more
consistently
that
the
spirit
of
disinterested
inquiry
must
have
free
play
in
these
seminaries
of
the
higher
learning
without
afterthought
as
to
the
practical
or
utilitarian
consequences
which
this
free
inquiry
may
conceivably
have
for
the
professional
training
or
for
the
social
civil
or
religious
temper
of
the
students
or
the
rest
of
the
community
Nothing
is
felt
to
be
so
irremediably
vicious
in
academic
policy
as
a
coercive
bias
religious
political
conventional
or
professional
in
so
far
as
it
touches
that
quest
of
knowledge
that
constitutes
the
main
interest
of
the
university
Professional
training
and
technological
work
at
large
have
of
course
not
lost
ground
either
in
the
volume
and
the
rigour
of
their
requirements
or
in
the
application
bestowed
in
their
pursuit
but
as
within
the
circle
of
academic
interests
these
utilitarian
disciplines
have
lost
their
preferential
place
and
have
been
pushed
to
one
side
so
that
the
professional
and
technical
schools
are
now
in
fact
rated
as
adjuncts
rather
than
as
integral
constituents
of
the
university
corporation
Such
is
the
unmistakable
sense
of
this
matter
among
academic
men
At
the
same
time
these
vocational
schools
have
one
with
another
progressively
taken
on
more
of
a
distinctive
independent
and
close-knit
structure
an
individual
corporate
existence
autonomous
and
academically
self-sufficient
even
in
those
cases
where
they
most
tenaciously
hold
to
their
formal
connection
with
the
university
corporation
They
have
reached
a
mature
phase
of
organization
developed
a
type
of
personnel
and
control
peculiar
to
themselves
and
their
special
needs
and
have
in
effect
come
out
from
under
the
tutelage
of
the
comprehensive
academic
organization
of
which
they
once
in
their
early
days
were
the
substantial
core
These
schools
have
more
in
common
among
themselves
as
a
class
than
their
class
have
with
the
academic
aims
and
methods
that
characterize
the
university
proper
They
are
in
fact
ready
and
competent
to
go
on
their
own
recognizances
indeed
they
commonly
resent
any
effective
interference
or
surveillance
from
the
side
of
the
academic
corporation
of
which
they
nominally
continue
to
be
members
and
insist
on
going
their
own
way
and
arranging
their
own
affairs
as
they
know
best
Their
connection
with
the
university
is
superficial
and
formal
at
the
best
so
far
as
regards
any
substantial
control
of
their
affairs
and
policy
by
the
university
authorities
at
large
it
is
only
in
their
interference
with
academic
policy
and
in
injecting
their
own
peculiar
bias
into
university
affairs
that
they
count
substantially
as
corporate
members
of
the
academic
body
And
in
these
respects
what
is
said
of
the
professional
and
technical
schools
holds
true
also
of
the
undergraduate
departments
It
is
quite
feasible
to
have
a
university
without
professional
schools
and
without
an
undergraduate
department
but
it
is
not
possible
to
have
one
without
due
provision
for
that
non-utilitarian
higher
learning
about
which
as
a
nucleus
these
utilitarian
disciplines
cluster
And
this
in
spite
of
the
solicitous
endeavours
of
the
professional
schools
to
make
good
their
footing
as
the
substantial
core
of
the
corporation
V
As
intimated
above
there
are
two
main
reasons
for
the
continued
and
tenacious
connection
between
these
schools
and
the
universities
a
ancient
tradition
fortified
by
the
solicitous
ambition
of
the
university
directorate
to
make
a
brave
show
of
magnitude
and
b
the
anxiety
of
these
schools
to
secure
some
degree
of
scholarly
authentication
through
such
a
formal
connection
with
a
seat
of
learning
These
two
motives
have
now
and
again
pushed
matters
fairly
to
an
extreme
in
the
reactionary
direction
So
for
instance
the
chances
of
intrigue
and
extra-academic
clamour
have
latterly
thrown
up
certain
men
of
untempered
practicality
as
directive
heads
of
certain
universities
and
some
of
these
have
gone
so
far
as
to
avow
a
reactionary
intention
to
make
the
modern
university
a
cluster
of
professional
schools
or
faculties
after
the
ancient
barbarian
fashion
9
But
such
a
policy
of
return
to
the
lost
crudities
is
unworkable
in
the
long
run
under
modern
conditions
It
may
serve
excellently
as
a
transient
expedient
in
a
campaign
of
popularity
and
such
appears
to
have
been
its
chief
purpose
where
a
move
of
this
kind
has
been
advocated
but
it
runs
on
superficial
grounds
and
can
afford
neither
hope
nor
fear
of
a
permanent
diversion
in
the
direction
so
spoken
for
In
the
modern
community
under
the
strain
of
the
price
system
and
the
necessities
of
competitive
earning
and
spending
many
men
and
women
are
driven
by
an
habitual
bias
in
favour
of
a
higher
practical
efficiency
in
all
matters
of
education
that
is
to
say
a
more
single-minded
devotion
to
the
needs
of
earning
and
spending
There
is
indeed
much
of
this
spirit
abroad
in
the
community
and
any
candidate
for
popular
favour
and
prestige
may
find
his
own
advantage
in
conciliating
popular
sentiment
of
this
kind
But
there
is
at
the
same
time
equally
prevalent
through
the
community
a
long-term
bias
of
another
kind
such
as
will
not
enduringly
tolerate
the
sordid
effects
of
pursuing
an
educational
policy
that
looks
mainly
to
the
main
chance
and
unreservedly
makes
the
means
of
life
its
chief
end
By
virtue
of
this
long-term
idealistic
drift
any
seminary
of
learning
that
plays
fast
and
loose
in
this
way
with
the
cultural
interests
entrusted
to
its
keeping
loses
caste
and
falls
out
of
the
running
The
universities
that
are
subjected
in
this
fashion
to
an
experimental
reversion
to
vocationalism
it
appears
will
unavoidably
return
presently
to
something
of
the
non-professional
type
on
pain
of
falling
into
hopeless
discredit
There
have
been
some
striking
instances
but
current
not
ions
of
delicacy
will
scarcely
admit
a
citation
of
nam
es
and
dates
And
while
the
long-term
drift
of
the
modern
idealistic
bias
may
not
permit
the
universities
permanently
to
be
diverted
to
the
service
of
Mammon
in
this
fashion
yet
the
unremitting
endeavours
of
educators
seeking
prestige
for
worldly
wisdom
results
at
the
best
in
a
fluctuating
state
of
compromise
in
which
the
ill
effects
of
such
bids
for
popularity
are
continually
being
outworn
by
the
drift
of
academic
usage
The
point
is
illustrated
by
the
American
state
universities
as
a
class
although
the
illustration
is
by
no
means
uniformly
convincing
The
greater
number
of
these
state
schools
are
not
or
are
not
yet
universities
except
in
name
These
establishments
have
been
founded
commonly
with
a
professed
utilitarian
purpose
and
have
started
out
with
professional
training
as
their
chief
avowed
aim
The
purpose
made
most
of
in
their
establishment
has
commonly
been
to
train
young
men
for
proficiency
in
some
gainful
occupation
along
with
this
have
gone
many
half-articulate
professions
of
solicitude
for
cultural
interests
to
be
taken
care
of
by
the
same
means
They
have
been
installed
by
politicians
looking
for
popular
acclaim
rather
than
by
men
of
scholarly
or
scientific
insight
and
their
management
has
not
infrequently
been
entrusted
to
political
masters
of
intrigue
with
scant
academic
qualifications
their
foundations
has
been
the
work
of
practical
politicians
with
a
view
to
conciliate
the
good
will
of
a
lay
constituency
clamouring
for
things
tangibly
useful
that
is
to
say
pecuniarily
gainful
So
these
experts
in
short-term
political
prestige
have
made
provision
for
schools
of
a
practical
character
but
they
have
named
these
establishments
universities
because
the
name
carries
an
air
of
scholarly
repute
of
a
higher
more
substantial
kind
than
any
naked
avowal
of
material
practicality
would
give
Yet
in
those
instances
where
the
passage
of
time
has
allowed
the
readjustment
to
take
place
these
quasi
universities
installed
by
men
of
affairs
of
a
crass
practicality
and
in
response
to
the
utilitarian
demands
of
an
unlearned
political
constituency
have
in
the
long
run
taken
on
more
and
more
of
an
academic
non-utilitarian
character
and
have
been
gradually
falling
into
line
as
universities
claiming
a
place
among
the
seminaries
of
the
higher
learning
The
long-term
drift
of
modern
cultural
ideals
leaves
these
schools
no
final
resting
place
short
of
the
university
type
however
far
short
of
such
a
consummation
the
greater
number
of
them
may
still
be
found
What
has
just
been
said
of
the
place
which
the
university
occupies
in
modern
civilization
and
more
particularly
of
the
manner
in
which
it
is
to
fill
its
place
may
seem
something
of
a
fancy
sketch
It
is
assuredly
not
a
faithful
description
of
any
concrete
case
by
all
means
not
of
any
given
American
university
nor
does
it
faithfully
describe
the
line
of
policy
currently
pursued
by
the
directorate
of
any
such
establishment
Yet
it
is
true
to
the
facts
taken
in
a
generalized
way
and
it
describes
the
type
to
which
the
American
schools
unavoidably
gravitate
by
force
of
the
community's
long-term
idealistic
impulsion
in
so
far
as
their
drift
is
not
continually
corrected
and
offset
by
vigilant
authorities
who
from
motives
of
their
own
seek
to
turn
the
universities
to
account
in
one
way
and
another
It
describes
an
institutional
ideal
not
necessarily
an
ideal
nursed
by
any
given
individual
but
the
ideal
logically
involved
in
the
scheme
of
modern
civilization
and
logically
coming
out
of
the
historical
development
of
Western
civilization
hitherto
and
visible
to
any
one
who
will
dispassionately
stand
aside
and
look
to
the
drift
of
latterday
events
in
so
far
as
they
bear
on
this
matter
of
the
higher
learning
its
advancement
and
conservation
Many
if
not
most
of
those
men
who
are
occupied
with
the
guidance
of
university
affairs
would
disown
such
a
projected
ideal
as
being
too
narrow
and
too
unpractical
to
fit
into
the
modern
scheme
of
things
which
is
above
all
else
a
culture
of
affairs
that
it
does
not
set
forth
what
should
be
aimed
at
by
any
who
have
the
good
of
mankind
at
heart
or
who
in
any
sensible
degree
appreciate
the
worth
of
real
work
as
contrasted
with
the
leisurely
intellectual
finesse
of
the
confirmed
scientist
and
man
of
letters
These
and
the
like
objections
and
strictures
may
be
well
taken
perhaps
The
question
of
what
in
any
ulterior
sense
ought
to
be
sought
after
in
the
determination
of
academic
policy
and
the
conduct
of
academic
affairs
will
however
not
coincide
with
the
other
question
as
to
what
actually
is
being
accomplished
in
these
premises
on
the
one
hand
nor
as
to
what
the
long-term
cultural
aspirations
of
civilized
men
are
setting
toward
on
the
other
hand
Now
it
is
not
intended
here
to
argue
the
merits
of
the
current
cultural
ideals
as
contrasted
with
what
in
some
ulterior
sense
ought
to
be
aimed
at
if
the
drift
of
current
aspirations
and
impulse
should
conceivably
permit
a
different
ideal
to
be
put
into
effect
It
is
intended
only
to
set
forth
what
place
in
point
of
fact
and
for
better
or
worse
the
higher
learning
and
the
university
hold
in
the
current
scheme
of
Western
civilization
as
determined
by
that
body
of
instinctive
aspirations
and
proclivities
that
holds
this
civilization
to
its
course
as
it
runs
today
and
further
to
show
how
and
how
far
certain
institutional
factors
comprised
in
this
modern
scheme
of
life
go
to
help
or
hinder
the
realization
of
this
ideal
which
men's
aspirations
and
proclivities
so
make
worth
while
to
them
The
sketch
here
offered
in
characterization
of
the
university
and
its
work
therefore
endeavours
to
take
account
of
the
community's
consensus
of
impulses
and
desires
touching
the
animus
and
aims
that
should
move
the
seminaries
of
the
higher
learning
at
the
same
time
that
it
excludes
those
subsidiary
or
alien
interests
in
whose
favour
no
such
consensus
is
found
to
prevail
There
are
many
of
these
workday
interests
extraneous
to
the
higher
learning
each
and
several
of
which
may
be
abundantly
good
and
urgent
in
its
own
right
but
while
they
need
not
be
at
cross
purposes
with
the
higher
learning
they
are
extraneous
to
that
disinterested
pursuit
of
knowledge
in
which
the
characteristic
intellectual
bent
of
modern
civilization
culminates
These
others
are
patent
insistent
and
palpable
and
there
need
be
no
apprehension
of
their
going
by
default
The
intellectual
predilection
the
idle
curiosity
abides
and
asserts
itself
when
other
pursuits
of
a
more
temporal
but
more
immediately
urgent
kind
leave
men
free
to
take
stock
of
the
ulterior
ends
and
values
of
life
whereas
the
transient
interests
preoccupation
with
the
ways
and
means
of
life
are
urgent
and
immediate
and
employ
men's
thought
and
energy
through
the
greater
share
of
their
life
The
question
of
material
ways
and
means
and
the
detail
requirements
of
the
day's
work
are
for
ever
at
hand
and
for
ever
contest
the
claims
of
any
avowed
ulterior
end
and
by
force
of
unremitting
habituation
the
current
competitive
system
of
acquisition
and
expenditure
induces
in
all
classes
such
a
bias
as
leads
them
to
overrate
ways
and
means
as
contrasted
with
the
ends
which
these
ways
and
means
are
in
some
sense
designed
to
serve
So
one
class
and
another
biassed
by
the
habitual
preoccupation
of
the
class
will
aim
to
divert
the
academic
equipment
to
some
particular
use
which
habit
has
led
them
to
rate
high
or
to
include
in
the
academic
discipline
various
lines
of
inquiry
and
training
which
are
extraneous
to
the
higher
learning
but
which
the
class
in
question
may
specially
have
at
heart
but
taking
them
one
with
another
there
is
no
general
or
abiding
consensus
among
the
various
classes
of
the
community
in
favour
of
diverting
the
academic
establishment
to
any
other
specific
uses
or
of
including
in
the
peculiar
work
of
the
university
anything
beyond
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
Now
it
may
be
remarked
by
the
way
that
civilized
mankind
should
have
come
so
to
set
their
heart
on
this
chase
after
a
fugitive
knowledge
of
inconsequential
facts
may
be
little
to
the
credit
of
the
race
or
of
that
scheme
of
culture
that
so
centres
about
this
cult
of
the
idle
curiosity
And
it
is
perhaps
to
their
credit
as
well
as
to
the
credit
of
the
community
whose
creatures
they
are
that
the
spokesmen
of
some
tangible
ideal
some
materially
expedient
aspiration
embodying
more
of
worldly
wisdom
are
for
ever
urging
upon
the
institutions
of
the
higher
leaning
one
or
another
course
of
action
of
a
more
palpably
expedient
kind
But
for
better
or
worse
the
passage
of
time
brings
out
the
fact
that
these
sober
and
sensible
courses
of
policy
so
advocated
are
after
all
essentially
extraneous
if
not
alien
to
those
purposes
for
which
a
university
can
be
maintained
on
the
ground
afforded
by
the
habits
of
thought
prevalent
in
the
modern
civilized
community
One
and
another
of
these
practical
and
expedient
interests
have
transiently
come
to
the
front
in
academic
policy
and
have
in
their
time
given
a
particular
bent
to
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
that
has
occupied
the
universities
Of
these
extraneous
interests
the
two
most
notable
have
as
already
indicated
above
been
the
ecclesiastical
and
the
political
But
in
the
long
run
these
various
interests
and
ideals
of
expediency
have
all
and
several
shown
themselves
to
be
only
factional
elements
in
the
scheme
of
culture
and
have
lost
their
preferential
voice
in
the
shaping
of
academic
life
The
place
in
men's
esteem
once
filled
by
church
and
state
is
now
held
by
pecuniary
traffic
business
enterprise
So
that
the
graver
issues
of
academic
policy
which
now
tax
the
discretion
of
the
directive
powers
reduce
themselves
in
the
main
to
a
question
between
the
claims
of
science
and
scholarship
on
the
one
hand
and
those
of
business
principles
and
pecuniary
gain
on
the
other
hand
In
one
shape
or
another
this
problem
of
adjustment
reconciliation
or
compromise
between
the
needs
of
the
higher
learning
and
the
demands
of
business
enterprise
is
for
ever
present
in
the
deliberations
of
the
university
directorate
This
question
gathers
in
its
net
all
those
perplexing
details
of
expediency
that
now
claim
the
attention
of
the
ruling
bodies
VI
Since
the
paragraphs
that
make
up
the
foregoing
chapter
were
written
the
American
academic
community
has
been
thrown
into
a
new
and
peculiar
position
by
the
fortunes
of
war
The
progress
and
the
further
promise
of
the
war
hold
in
prospect
new
and
untried
responsibilities
as
well
as
an
unexampled
opportunity
So
that
the
outlook
now
June
1918
would
seem
to
be
that
the
Americans
are
to
be
brought
into
a
central
place
in
the
republic
of
learning
to
take
a
position
not
so
much
of
dominance
as
of
trust
and
guardianship
not
so
much
by
virtue
of
their
own
superior
merit
as
by
force
of
the
insolvency
of
the
European
academic
community
Again
it
is
not
that
the
war
is
expected
to
leave
the
lines
of
European
scholars
and
scientists
extinct
although
there
is
no
denying
the
serious
inroads
made
by
the
war
both
in
the
way
of
a
high
mortality
among
European
men
of
learning
and
in
the
way
of
a
decimation
of
the
new
men
on
whom
the
hopes
of
the
higher
learning
for
the
incoming
generation
should
have
rested
There
is
also
a
serious
diversion
of
the
young
forces
from
learning
to
transiently
urgent
matters
of
a
more
material
and
more
ephemeral
nature
But
possibly
more
sinister
than
all
these
losses
that
are
in
a
way
amenable
to
statistical
record
and
estimate
is
the
current
and
prospective
loss
of
morale
Naturally
it
would
be
difficult
and
hazardous
to
offer
an
appraisal
of
this
prospective
loss
of
morale
with
which
it
is
to
be
expected
that
the
disintegrated
European
community
of
learned
men
will
come
through
the
troubled
times
But
that
there
is
much
to
be
looked
for
on
this
score
that
there
is
much
to
be
written
off
in
the
way
of
lowered
aggregate
efficiency
and
loss
of
the
spirit
of
team-work
that
much
there
is
no
denying
and
it
is
useless
to
blink
the
fact
There
has
already
a
good
deal
of
disillusionment
taken
effect
throughout
the
nations
of
Christendom
in
respect
of
the
temper
and
trustworthiness
of
German
scholarship
these
past
three
or
four
years
and
it
is
fairly
beyond
computation
what
further
shift
of
sentiment
in
this
respect
is
to
be
looked
for
in
the
course
of
a
further
Possible
period
of
years
given
over
to
the
same
line
of
experience
Doubtless
the
German
scholars
and
therefore
the
German
seats
of
learning
whose
creatures
and
whose
custodians
these
German
scholars
are
have
earned
much
of
the
distrust
and
dispraise
that
is
falling
to
their
share
There
is
no
overlooking
the
fact
that
they
have
proved
the
frailty
of
their
hold
on
those
elementary
principles
of
sobriety
and
single
mind
that
underlie
all
sound
work
in
the
field
of
learning
To
any
one
who
has
the
interest
of
the
higher
learning
at
heart
the
spectacle
of
maudlin
chauvinism
and
inflated
scurrility
unremittingly
placed
on
view
by
the
putative
leaders
of
German
science
and
scholarship
can
not
but
be
exceedingly
disheartening
It
may
be
argued
and
it
may
be
true
of
course
that
much
of
this
failure
of
intelligence
and
spiritual
force
among
Germany's
men
of
learning
is
of
the
nature
of
a
transient
eclipse
of
their
powers
that
with
the
return
of
settled
conditions
there
is
due
to
come
a
return
of
poise
and
insight
But
when
all
due
argument
has
been
heard
it
remains
true
that
the
distrust
set
afoot
in
the
mind
of
their
neighbours
by
this
highly
remarkable
exhibition
of
their
personal
equation
will
long
inure
to
the
disability
of
Germany's
men
of
learning
as
a
force
to
be
counted
on
in
that
teamwork
that
is
of
the
essence
of
things
for
the
advancement
of
learning
In
effect
Germany
and
Germany's
associates
in
this
warlike
enterprise
will
presumably
be
found
bankrupt
in
this
respect
on
the
return
of
peace
even
beyond
the
other
nations
These
others
have
also
not
escaped
the
touch
of
the
angel
of
decay
but
the
visible
corruption
of
spiritual
and
intellectual
values
does
not
go
the
same
length
among
them
Nor
have
these
others
suffered
so
heavy
a
toll
on
their
prospective
scholarly
man
power
It
is
all
a
matter
of
degree
and
of
differential
decline
coupled
with
a
failure
of
corporate
organization
and
of
the
usages
and
channels
of
communion
and
co-operation
Chauvinistic
self-sufficiency
and
disesteem
of
their
neighbours
have
apparently
also
not
gone
so
deep
and
far
among
the
other
nations
although
here
again
it
is
only
a
relative
degree
of
immunity
that
they
enjoy
And
all
this
holds
true
of
the
Americans
in
much
the
same
way
as
of
the
rest
except
that
the
Americans
have
at
least
hitherto
not
been
exposed
to
the
blight
in
anything
like
the
same
degree
as
any
one
of
those
other
peoples
with
whom
they
come
in
comparison
here
It
is
of
course
not
easy
to
surmise
what
may
yet
overtake
them
and
the
others
with
them
but
judged
on
the
course
of
things
hitherto
and
on
the
apparent
promise
of
the
calculable
future
it
is
scarcely
to
be
presumed
that
the
Americans
are
due
to
suffer
so
extreme
a
degree
of
dilapidation
as
the
European
peoples
even
apart
from
the
accentuated
evil
case
of
the
Germans
The
strain
has
hitherto
been
lighter
here
and
it
promises
so
to
continue
whether
the
further
duration
of
the
war
shall
turn
out
to
be
longer
or
shorter
The
Americans
are
after
all
somewhat
sheltered
from
the
impact
and
so
soon
as
the
hysterical
anxiety
induced
by
the
shock
has
had
time
to
spend
itself
it
should
reasonably
be
expected
that
this
people
will
be
able
soberly
to
take
stock
of
its
assets
and
to
find
that
its
holdings
in
the
domain
of
science
and
scholarship
are
in
the
main
still
intact
Not
that
no
loss
has
been
incurred
nor
that
no
material
degree
of
derangement
is
to
be
looked
for
but
in
comparison
with
what
the
experience
of
the
war
is
bringing
to
the
Europeans
the
case
of
the
Americans
should
still
be
the
best
there
is
to
be
looked
for
and
the
best
is
always
good
enough
perforce
So
it
becomes
a
question
what
the
Americans
will
do
with
the
best
opportunity
which
the
circumstances
offer
And
on
their
conduct
of
their
affairs
in
this
bearing
turns
not
only
their
own
fortune
in
respect
of
the
interests
of
science
and
scholarship
but
in
great
measure
the
fortunes
of
their
overseas
friends
and
co-partners
in
the
republic
of
learning
as

The
fortunes
of
war
promise
to
leave
the
American
men
of
learning
in
a
strategic
position
in
the
position
of
a
strategic
reserve
of
a
force
to
be
held
in
readiness
equipped
and
organized
to
meet
the
emergency
that
so
arises
and
to
retrieve
so
much
as
may
be
of
those
assets
of
scholarly
equipment
and
personnel
that
make
the
substantial
code
of
Western
civilization
And
so
it
becomes
a
question
of
what
the
Americans
are
minded
to
do
about
it
It
is
their
opportunity
and
at
the
same
time
it
carries
the
gravest
responsibility
that
has
yet
fallen
on
the
nation
for
the
spiritual
fortunes
of
Christendom
are
bound
up
with
the
line
of
policy
which
this
surviving
contingent
of
American
men
of
learning
shall
see
fit
to
pursue
They
are
not
all
that
is
to
be
left
over
when
the
powers
of
decay
shall
begin
to
retire
nor
are
they
perhaps
to
be
the
best
and
most
valuable
contingent
among
these
prospective
survivors
but
they
occupy
a
strategic
position
in
that
they
are
today
justly
to
be
credited
with
disinterested
motives
beyond
the
rest
at
the
same
time
that
they
command
those
material
resources
without
which
the
quest
of
knowledge
can
hope
to
achieve
little
along
the
modern
lines
of
inquiry
By
force
of
circumstances
they
are
thrown
into
the
position
of
keepers
of
the
ways
and
means
whereby
the
republic
of
learning
is
to
retrieve
its
fortunes
By
force
of
circumstances
they
are
in
a
position
if
they
so
choose
to
shelter
many
of
those
masters
of
free
inquiry
whom
the
one-eyed
forces
of
reaction
and
partisanship
overseas
will
seek
to
suppress
and
undo
and
they
are
also
in
a
position
if
they
so
choose
to
install
something
in
the
way
of
an
international
clearing
house
and
provisional
headquarters
for
the
academic
community
throughout
that
range
of
civilized
peoples
whose
goodwill
they
now
enjoy
a
place
of
refuge
and
a
place
of
meeting
confluence
and
dissemination
for
those
views
and
ideas
that
live
and
move
and
have
their
being
in
the
higher
learning
There
is
therefore
a
work
of
reconstruction
to
be
taken
care
of
in
the
realm
of
learning
no
less
than
in
the
working
scheme
of
economic
and
civil
institutions
And
as
in
this
other
work
of
reconstruction
so
here
if
it
is
to
be
done
without
undue
confusion
and
blundering
it
is
due
to
be
set
afoot
before
the
final
emergency
is
at
hand
But
there
is
the
difference
that
whereas
the
framework
of
civil
institutions
may
still
with
passable
success
be
drawn
on
national
lines
and
confined
within
the
national
frontiers
and
while
the
economic
organization
can
also
without
fatal
loss
be
confined
in
a
similar
fashion
in
response
to
short-sighted
patriotic
preconceptions
the
interests
of
science
and
therefore
of
the
academic
community
do
not
run
on
national
lines
and
can
not
similarly
be
confined
within
geographical
or
political
boundaries
In
the
nature
of
the
case
these
interests
are
of
an
international
character
and
can
not
be
taken
care
of
except
by
unrestricted
collusion
and
collaboration
among
the
learned
men
of
all
those
peoples
whom
it
may
concern
Yet
there
is
no
mistaking
the
fact
that
the
spirit
of
invidious
patriotism
has
invaded
these
premises
too
and
promises
to
bungle
the
outcome
which
makes
the
needed
work
of
reconstruction
all
the
more
difficult
and
all
the
more
imperative
Unhappily
the
state
of
sentiment
on
both
sides
of
the
line
of
cleavage
will
presumably
not
admit
a
cordial
understanding
and
co-operation
between
the
German
contingent
and
the
rest
of
the
civilized
nations
for
some
time
to
come
But
the
others
are
in
a
frame
of
mind
that
should
lend
itself
generously
to
a
larger
measure
of
co-operation
in
this
respect
now
than
ever
before
So
it
may
not
seem
out
of
place
to
offer
a
suggestion
tentatively
and
under
correction
looking
to
this
end
A
beginning
may
well
be
made
by
a
joint
enterprise
among
American
scholars
and
universities
for
the
installation
of
a
freely
endowed
central
establishment
where
teachers
and
students
of
all
nationalities
including
Americans
with
the
rest
may
pursue
their
chosen
work
as
guests
of
the
American
academic
community
at
large
or
as
guests
of
the
American
people
in
the
character
of
a
democracy
of
culture
There
should
also
be
nothing
to
hinder
the
installation
of
more
than
one
of
these
academic
houses
of
refuge
and
entertainment
nor
should
there
be
anything
to
hinder
the
enterprise
being
conducted
on
such
terms
of
amity
impartiality
and
community
interest
as
will
make
recourse
to
it
an
easy
matter
of
course
for
any
scholars
whom
its
opportunities
may
attract
The
same
central
would
at
the
same
time
and
for
the
time
being
take
care
of
those
channels
of
communication
throughout
the
academic
world
that
have
been
falling
into
enforced
neglect
under
the
strain
of
the
war
So
also
should
provision
be
made
perhaps
best
under
the
same
auspices
for
the
transient
taking-over
of
the
many
essential
lines
of
publicity
and
publication
on
which
the
men
engaged
in
scholarly
and
scientific
inquiry
have
learned
to
depend
and
which
have
also
been
falling
into
something
of
a
decline
during
the
war
Measures
looking
to
this
end
might
well
be
made
at
the
same
time
to
serve
no
less
useful
a
purpose
within
the
American
Academic
community
As
is
well
known
there
prevails
today
an
extensive
and
wasteful
competitive
duplication
of
plant
organization
and
personnel
among
the
American
universities
as
regards
both
publications
and
courses
of
instruction
Particularly
is
this
true
in
respect
of
that
advanced
work
of
the
universities
that
has
to
do
with
the
higher
learning
At
the
same
time
these
universities
are
now
pinched
for
funds
due
to
the
current
inflation
of
prices
So
that
any
proposal
of
this
nature
which
might
be
taken
advantage
of
as
an
occasion
for
the
pooling
of
common
issues
among
the
universities
might
hopefully
be
expected
to
be
welcomed
as
a
measure
of
present
relief
from
some
part
of
the
pecuniary
strain
under
which
they
are
now
working
But
competition
is
well
ingrained
in
the
habitual
outlook
of
the
American
schools
To
take
the
issue
to
neutral
ground
therefore
where
this
competitive
animus
may
hopefully
be
counted
on
to
find
some
salutary
abatement
it
may
be
suggested
that
a
practicable
nucleus
for
this
proposed
joint
enterprise
can
well
be
found
in
one
or
another
perhaps
in
one
and
another
of
those
extra-academic
foundations
for
research
of
which
there
already
are
several
in
existence
as
e.g
the
Carnegie
Institution
With
somewhat
enlarged
powers
or
perhaps
rather
with
some
abatement
of
restrictions
and
with
such
additional
funds
as
may
be
required
the
necessary
work
and
organization
should
readily
be
taken
care
of
by
such
an
institution
Further
growth
and
ramification
would
be
left
to
future
counsel
and
advisement
The
contemplated
enterprise
would
necessarily
require
a
certain
planning
and
organization
of
work
and
something
in
the
way
of
an
administrative
and
clerical
staff,a
setting
up
of
something
in
the
way
of
organization
tables
but
there
can
be
no
question
of
offering
detailed
proposals
on
that
head
here
Yet
the
caution
may
well
be
entered
here
that
few
specifications
are
better
than
many
in
these
premises
and
that
the
larger
the
latitude
allowed
from
the
outset
the
fewer
the
seeds
of
eventual
defeat
as
is
abundantly
illustrated
by
contraries
It
is
also
evident
that
such
an
enterprise
will
involve
provision
for
some
expenditure
of
funds
presumably
a
somewhat
generous
expenditure
which
comes
near
implying
that
recourse
should
be
had
to
the
public
revenues
or
to
resources
that
may
legitimately
be
taken
over
by
the
public
authorities
from
private
hands
where
they
now
serve
no
useful
purpose
There
are
many
items
of
material
resources
in
the
country
that
come
legitimately
under
this
head
At
the
same
time
it
is
well
in
this
connection
to
call
to
mind
that
there
is
no
prospect
of
the
country's
being
in
any
degree
impoverished
in
the
course
of
the
war
so
that
there
need
be
no
apprehension
of
a
shortage
of
means
for
the
carrying
on
of
such
an
enterprise
if
only
the
available
sources
are
drawn
on
without
prejudice
In
the
mind
of
any
disinterested
student
of
the
American
economic
situation
there
can
be
no
serious
apprehension
that
the
American
people
collectively
will
be
at
all
worse
off
in
point
of
disposable
means
at
the
close
of
the
war
than
they
were
at
its
beginning
quite
the
contrary
in
fact
To
any
one
who
will
look
to
the
facts
it
is
evident
that
the
experience
of
the
war
and
the
measures
taken
and
to
be
taken
are
leading
to
a
heightened
industrial
productiveness
and
a
concomitant
elimination
of
waste
The
resulting
net
gain
in
productive
efficiency
has
not
gone
at
all
far
and
there
need
be
no
apprehension
of
its
going
to
great
lengths
but
for
more
or
less
it
is
going
so
far
as
safely
to
promise
a
larger
net
annual
production
of
useful
goods
in
the
immediate
future
than
in
the
immediate
past
and
the
disposable
means
of
any
people
is
always
a
matter
of
the
net
annual
production
and
it
need
be
a
question
of
nothing
else
The
manner
in
which
this
net
product
is
and
is
to
be
shared
among
the
classes
and
individuals
of
the
community
is
another
question
which
does
not
belong
here
A
question
of
graver
weight
and
of
greater
perplexity
touches
the
presumptive
attitude
of
the
several
universities
and
their
discretionary
authorities
in
the
face
of
any
proposed
measure
of
this
kind
where
the
scope
of
the
enterprise
is
so
far
beyond
their
habitual
range
of
interest
When
one
calls
to
mind
the
habitual
parochialism
of
the
governing
boards
of
these
seminaries
of
the
higher
learning
and
the
meticulous
manoeuvres
of
their
executives
seeking
each
to
enhance
his
own
prestige
and
the
prestige
of
his
own
establishment
there
is
not
much
of
an
evident
outlook
for
large
and
generous
measures
looking
to
the
common
good
And
yet
it
is
also
to
be
called
to
mind
that
these
governing
boards
and
executives
are
after
all
drawn
from
the
common
stock
of
humanity
picked
men
as
they
may
be
and
that
they
are
subject
after
all
to
somewhat
the
same
impulses
and
infirmities
as
the
common
run
picked
though
they
may
be
with
a
view
to
parochialism
and
blameless
futility
Now
what
is
overtaking
the
temper
of
the
common
run
under
the
strain
of
the
war
situation
should
be
instructive
as
to
what
may
be
also
looked
for
at
the
bands
of
these
men
in
whose
discretion
rest
the
fortunes
of
the
American
universities
There
should
be
at
least
a
fighting
chance
that
with
something
larger
manlier
more
substantial
to
occupy
their
attention
and
to
shape
the
day's
work
for
them
these
seminaries
of
learning
may
under
instant
pressure
turn
their
best
efforts
to
their
ostensible
purpose
the
increase
and
diffusion
of
knowledge
among
men
and
to
forego
their
habitual
preoccupation
with
petty
intrigue
and
bombastic
publicity
until
the
return
of
idler
days

Toward
Human-Level
Cognitive
Adequacy
Our
long-range
aim
is
to
design

implement
common
sense
in
a
computer
Click

for
details
If
you
would
like
to
learn
more
about
Active
Logic
we
suggest
you
start
with
one
of
our
primers
Our
acronym
ALMECOM
stands
for
Active
Logic
Metacognitive
Computation
and
Mind
Active
Logic
is
a
time-sensitive
formalism
that
has
been
developed
with
real-world
applications
and
their
challenges
in
mind
Active
logic
explicitly
reasons
in
time
and
incorporates
a
history
of
its
reasoning
as
it
runs
This
characteristic
makes
active
logic
more
flexible
than
traditional
AI
systems
and
therefore
more
suitable
for
commonsense
real-world
reasoning
One
important
strategy
that
we
employ
in
active
logic
is
metareasoning
Because
active
logic
tracks
its
reasoning
it
is
able
to
reason
about
its
own
inferences
and
thereby
recognize
and
recover
from
errors
We
hypothesize
the
existence
of
a
limited
and
formalizable
set
of
generic
strategies
of
metareasoning
which
are
central
to
the
human
mind's
ability
to
deal
easily
and
smoothly
with
mistakes
contradictions
and
other
irregularities
click
here
for
more
on
this
One
area
in
which
these
strategies
are
most
apparent
and
most
often
used
is
in
conversation
and
so
one
central
area
of
our
research
focuses
on
human-computer
natural-language
dialog

What
is
the
Semantic
Web
How
would
you
define
the
main
goals
of
the
Semantic
Web
The
Semantic
Web
is
a
Web
of
data
There
is
a
lot
of
data
we
all
use
every
day
and
it's
not
part
of
the
Web
For
example
I
can
see
my
bank
statements
on
the
web
and
my
photographs
and
I
can
see
my
appointments
in
a
calendar
But
can
I
see
my
photos
in
a
calendar
to
see
what
I
was
doing
when
I
took
them
Can
I
see
bank
statement
lines
in
a
calendar
Why
not
Because
we
don't
have
a
web
of
data
Because
data
is
controlled
by
applications
and
each
application
keeps
it
to
itself
The
vision
of
the
Semantic
Web
is
to
extend
principles
of
the
Web
from
documents
to
data
Data
should
be
accessed
using
the
general
Web
architecture
using
e.g
URI-s
data
should
be
related
to
one
another
just
as
documents
or
portions
of
documents
are
already
This
also
means
creation
of
a
common
framework
that
allows
data
to
be
shared
and
reused
across
application
enterprise
and
community
boundaries
to
be
processed
automatically
by
tools
as
well
as
manually
including
revealing
possible
new
relationships
among
pieces
of
data
Semantic
Web
technologies
can
be
used
in
a
variety
of
application
areas
for
example
in
data
integration
whereby
data
in
various
locations
and
various
formats
can
be
integrated
in
one
seamless
application
in
resource
discovery
and
classification
to
provide
better
domain
specific
search
engine
capabilities
in
cataloging
for
describing
the
content
and
content
relationships
available
at
a
particular
Web
site
page
or
digital
library
by
intelligent
software
agents
to
facilitate
knowledge
sharing
and
exchange
in
content
rating
in

there
any

any

What
are
the
major
building
blocks
of
the
Semantic
Web
In
order
to
achieve
the
goals
described
above
the
most
important
is
to
be
able
to
define
and
describe
the
relations
among
data
i.e
resources
on
the
Web
This
is
not
unlike
the
usage
of
hyperlinks
on
the
current
Web
that
connect
the
current
page
with
another
one
the
hyperlinks
defines
a
relationship
between
the
current
page
and
the
target
One
major
difference
is
that
on
the
Semantic
Web
such
relationships
can
be
established
between
any
two
resources
there
is
no
notion
of
current
page
Another
major
difference
is
that
the
relationship
i.e
the
link
itself
is
named
whereas
the
link
used
by
a
human
on
the
traditional
Web
is
not
and
their
role
is
deduced
by
the
human
reader
The
definition
of
those
relations
allow
for
a
better
and
automatic
interchange
of
data
RDF
which
is
one
of
the
fundamental
building
blocks
of
the
Semantic
Web
gives
a
formal
definition
for
that
interchange
On
that
basis
additional
building
blocks
are
built
around
this
central
notion
Some
examples
are
Tools
to
query
information
described
through
such
relationships
eg
SPARQL
Tools
to
have
a
finer
and
more
detailed
classification
and
characterization
of
those
relationships
as
well
as
the
resources
being
characterized
This
ensures
interoperability
more
complex
automatic
behaviors
For
example
a
community
can
agree
what
name
to
use
for
a
relationship
connecting
a
page
to
one’s
calendar
this
name
can
then
be
used
by
a
large
number
of
users
and
applications
without
the
necessity
to
redefine
such
names
every
time
E.g
RDF
Schemas
OWL
SKOS
For
more
complex
cases
tools
are
available
to
define
logical
relationships
among
resources
and
their
relationships
for
example
if
a
relationships
binds
a
person
to
his/her
email
address
it
is
feasible
to
declare
that
the
email
address
is
unique
ie
the
address
is
not
shared
by
several
persons
Tools
based
on
this
level
e.g
OWL
Rules
can
ensure
more
interoperability
can
reveal
inconsistencies
and
find
new
relationships
Tools
to
extract
from
and
to
bind
to
traditional
data
sources
to
ensure
their
interchange
with
data
from
other
sources
E.g
GRDDL
RDFa

What
is
the
killer
application
for
the
Semantic
Web
It
is
difficult
to
predict
what
a
killer
application
is
for
a
specific
technology
and
the
prediction
is
often
erroneous
That
said
the
integration
of
currently
unbound
and
independent
silos
of
data
in
a
coherent
application
is
certainly
a
good
candidate
Specific
examples
are
currently
explored

Will
I

Not
necessarily
at

not
directly

user
experience
rather
than
directly

Is
the
Semantic

just
research
or
does
it
have
industrial
applications
As
all
innovative
technologies
the
Semantic

underwent
an
evolution
starting
at
research
labs
being
then
picked
up
by
the
Open

community
then
by
small
and
specialized
startups
and
finally
by
business
in
general
Remember
the
Web
was
originally
developed
in
a
High
Energy
Physics

At
present
the
Semantic

is
increasingly
used
by
small

Oracle
IBM
Adobe
Software
AG
or
Yahoo
are
only
some
of
the
large
corporations
that
have
picked
up
this
technology
already
and
are
selling
tools
as
well
as
complete
business
solutions
Large
application
areas
like
the
Health
Care
and
Life

look
at
the
data

possibilities
of
the

as
one
of
the

Does
one
have
to
understand
the
theory
of
formal
ontologies
and
logic
to
use
the
Semantic
Web
First
of
all
as
pointed
out
elsewhere
in
this
document
one
can
develop
Semantic
Web
applications
without
using
ontologies
Very
useful
applications
can
be
built
without
those
relying
on
the
most
fundamental
and
simple
concept
of
the
Semantic

However
even
if
ontologies
rules
reasoners

are
used
the

should
not
care
about

How
is
the
Semantic

related
to
the
existing

The
Semantic

is
an
extension
of
the
current

and
not
its
replacement
Islands
of
RDF
and
possibly
related
ontologies
can
be
developed
incrementally
Major
application
areas
like
Health
Care
and
Life
Sciences
may
choose
to
locally
adopt
Semantic
Web
technologies
and
this
can
then
spread
over
the
Web
in
general
In
other
words
one
should
not
think
in

of
rebuilding
the

How
does
the
Semantic
Web
relate
to
Artificial
Intelligence
Some
parts
of
the
Semantic
Web
technologies
are
based
on
results
of
Artificial
Intelligence
research
like
knowledge
representation
e.g
for
ontologies
or
rules
model
theory
e.g
for
the
precise
semantics
of
RDF
and
RDF
Schemas
or
various
types
of
logics
e.g
for
rules
However
it
must
be
noted
that
Artificial
Intelligence
has
a
number
of
research
areas
e.g
image
recognition
that
are
completely
orthogonal
to
the
Semantic
Web
It
is
also
true
that
the
development
of
the
Semantic
Web
brought
some
new
perspectives
to
the
Artificial
Intelligence
community
the
Web
effect
i.e
the
merge
of
knowledge
coming
from
different
sources
usage
of

the

XML
When
should
I
use
RDF
and
when
should
I
use
XML
Both
formalisms
have
their
strengths
and
weaknesses
their
area
of
usage
is
different
The
two
data
models
serve
different
constituencies
and
the
choice
really
depends
on
the
application
There
is
no
better
or
worse
only
different
One
of
XML’s
strengths
is
its
ability
to
describe
strict
hierarchies
Applications
may
rely
on
and
indeed
exploit
the
position
of
an
element
in
a
hierarchy
for
example
most
browsers
provide
a
different
rendering
of
HTML’s
li
element
depending
on
how
deep
the
enclosing
list
is
XML
makes
it
easy
to
control
the
content
via
XML
Schemas
and
combine
XML
data
that
abide
to
the
same
Schema
or
DTD
However
combining
different
XML
hierarchies
technically
DOM
trees
within
the
same
application
may
become
very
complex
XML
is
not
an
easy
tool
for
data
integration
On
the
other
hand
RDF
consists
of
a
very
loose
set
of
relations
triples
Due
to
its
usage
of
URIs
it
is
very
easy
to
seamlessly
merge
triple
sets
ie
data
described
in
RDF
within
the
same
application
it
is
therefore
ideal
for
the
integration
of
possibly
heterogenous
information
on
the
Web
But
this
has
its
price
reconstructing
hierarchies
from
RDF
may
become
quite
complex
As
an
example
it
would
be
fairly
complicated
and
unnecessary
to
describe
eg
vector
graphics
using
RDF
use
SVG
instead
RDF
based
vocabularies
and
the
accompanying
semantic
formalisms
like
RDFS
or
OWL
also
make
it
easy
to
define
inference
possibilities
on
RDF
data
Although
this
could
be
done
around
XML
dialects
too
it
would
remain
application
specific
and
not
portable
For
existing
XML-based
vocabularies
one
can
develop
an
GRDDL
transformation
to
RDF
using
a
language
such
as
XSLT
and
then
use
the
power
of
RDF
to
merge
your
pre-existing
XML
formats
For
new
vocabularies
this
technique
allows
you
to
use
both
XML
and
RDF-based
versions
of
your
vocabulary
gaining
the
advantages
of
both
permalink
XML
Schemas
What
do
ontologies
buy
me
that
XML
and
XML
Schema
don't
This
issue
is
also
related
to
the
issue
of
using
XML
or
RDF
addressed
in
a
previous
question
First
of
all
let
us
quote
from
the
OWL
Guide
recommendation
An
ontology
differs
from
an
XML
Schema
in
that
it
is
a
knowledge
representation
not
a
message
format
Most
industry
based
Web
standards
consist
of
a
combination
of
message
formats
and
protocol
specifications
These
formats
have
been
given
an
operational
semantics
such
as
Upon
receipt
of
this
PurchaseOrder
message
transfer
Amount
dollars
from
AccountFrom
to
AccountTo
and
ship
Product
But
the
specification
is
not
designed
to
support
reasoning
outside
the
transaction
context
For
example
we
won’t
in
general
have
a
mechanism
to
conclude
that
because
the
Product
is
a
type
of
Chardonnay
it
must
also
be
a
white
wine
One
advantage
of
OWL
ontologies
will
be
the
availability
of
tools
that
can
reason
about
them
Tools
will
provide
generic
support
that
is
not
specific
to
the
particular
subject
domain
which
would
be
the
case
if
one
were
to
build
a
system
to
reason
about
a
specific
industry-standard
XML
schema
They
will
benefit
from
third
party
tools
based
on
the
formal
properties
of
the
OWL
language
tools
that
will
deliver
an
assortment
of
capabilities
that
most
organizations
would
be
hard
pressed
to
duplicate
Also
XML
data
is
very
sensitive
to
the
XML
Schema
it
refers
to
If
the
XML
Schema
changes
the
same
XML
data
may
become
invalid
i.e
being
rejected
by
Schema-aware
parsers
Somewhat
similar
dependence
on
RDF
Schemas
and
Ontologies
exist
for
RDF
data
too
if
the
RDF
Schema
or
OWL
Ontology
changes
the
inferences
drawn
from
the
RDF
data
may
change
However
the
core
RDF
data
is
still
usable
there
is
no
notion
of
the
data
being
rejected
by
e.g
a
parser
due
to
a
Schema/Ontology
change
In
general
RDF
is
more
robust
against
changing
of
Schemas
and
Ontologies
than
XML
is
versus
Schemas
Note
that
a
GRDDL
transformation
from
XML
to
RDF
may
be
given
by
an
XML
Schema
as
described
in
the
GRDDL
specification
This
allows
any
XML
document
that
validates
according
to
the
XML
Schema
given
at
the
namespace
URI
of
the
XML
vocabulary
to
be
converted
to
RDF
permalink
HTML
meta
headers
The
meta
and
link
elements
in
HTML
can
be
used
to
add
metadata
to
an
HTML
page
In
Semantic
Web
terms
this
is
equivalent
to
the
process
of
defining
RDF
relationships
for
that
page
as
a
source
Note
however
that
these
elements
can
be
used
to
define
relationships
for
the
enclosing
HTML
file
only
whereas
the
Semantic
Web
allows
the
definition
of
relationships
on
any
resource
on
the
Web
That
also
means
that
the
meta
and
link
elements
can
be
used
by
the
author
of
the
document
only
whereas
on
the
Semantic
Web
anybody
could
publish
metadata
concerning
that
page
GRDDL
allows
easy
and
automatic
extraction
of
meta
header
data
such
as
that
given
by
Dublin
Core
to
RDF
permalink
tagging
folksonomies
Tagging
has
emerged
as
a
popular
method
of
categorizing
content
Users
are
allowed
to
attach
arbitrary
strings
to
their
data
items
for
example
blog
entries
and
photographs
While
tagging
is
easy
and
useful
it
often
discards
a
lot
of
the
semantics
of
the
data
A
folksonomy
tag
is
typically
2
3
of
an
RDF
triple
The
subject
is
known
e.g
the
URL
for
the
flickr
image
being
tagged
or
the
URL
being
bookmarked
in
delicious
The
object
is
known
e.g
http
flickr.com/photos/tags/cats
or
http
del.icio.us/tag/cats
But
the
predicate
to
connect
them
is
often
missing
Machine-tags
lend
themselves
to
RDF
more
since
they
better
capture
the
relationship
between
the
subject
and
the
object
Folksonomy
providers
are
encouraged
to
capture
or
infer
the
semantics
around
their
tags
and
to
leverage
semantic
web
technologies
such
as
RDF
and
SKOS
to
publish
machine
readable
versions
of
their
concept
schemes
Another
issue
arising
with
tags
is
that
the
number
of
different
tags
meaning
the
same
things
but
differing
in
spelling
lower
or
upper
case
usage
of
space
or
underscore
characters
etc
may
create
major
obstacles
to
them
being
used
on
a
larger
scale
There
are
a
number
of
initiatives
start-up
companies
projects
etc
that
aim
at
combining
the
two
approaches
providing
a
little
bit
of
extra
rigour
using
Semantic
Web
techniques
to
create
new
type
of

microformats
Microformats
are
usually
relatively
small
and
simple
sets
of
terms
agreed
upon
by
a
community
Data
models
developed
within
the
framework
of
the
Semantic
Web
have
the
potential
to
be
more
expressive
rigorous
and
formal
and
are
usually
larger
Both
can
be
used
to
express
structured
data
within
web
pages
In
some
cases
microformats
are
appropriate
because
the
extra
features
provided
by
Semantic
Web
technologies
are
not
necessary
Other
cases
requiring
more
rigor
will
not
be
able
to
use
microformats
Data
described
in
microformats
each
address
a
specific
problem
area
One
has
to
develop
a
program
well-adapted
to
a
particular
microformat
to
the
way
it
uses
say
the
class
and
property
dc:date
content
attributes
It
also
becomes
difficult
though
possible
to
combine
different
microformats
In
contrast
RDF
can
represent
any
information—including
that
extracted
from
microformats
present
on
the
page
This
is
where
microformats
can
benefit
from
RDF—the
generality
of
the
Semantic
Web
tools
makes
it
easier
to
reuse
existing
tools
eg
a
query
language
and
combining
statements
from
different
origins
easily
belongs
to
the
very
essence
of
the
Semantic
Web
GRDDL
is
a
bridge
to
the
microformats
approach
it
defines
a
general
procedure
whereby
microformats
stored
in
an
XHTML
file
can
be
transformed
into
RDF
on–the–fly
A
list
of
microformat
to
RDF
vocabulary
can
be
found
on
on
the
ESW
Wiki
Another
technology
is
RDFa
that
defines
an
XHTML
1
1
module
giving
the
possibility
to
use
virtually
any
RDF
vocabulary
as
annotations
of
the
XHTML
content
a
bit
like
microformats
with
somewhat
more
rigor
and
a
better
way
of
integrating
different
vocabularies
within
the
same
document
There
is
also

ongoing
work

adapt
RDFa

How
do
I
participate
in
the
Semantic
Web
Does
the
Semantic
Web
require
me
to
manually
markup
all
the
existing
web-pages
or
to
convert
all
the
data
in
relational
databases
into
RDF
The
Semantic
Web
is
about
a
web
of
data
The
data
itself
can
reside
in
databases
spreadsheets
Wiki
pages
or
indeed
traditional
web
pages
The
challenge
is
to
develop
tools
that
can
export
these
data
into
RDF
form
RDF
plays
the
role
of
a
common
model
as
a
kind
of
a
glue
to
integrate
the
data
That
does
not
mean
that
the
data
must
be
physically
converted
into
RDF
form
and
stored
in
say
RDF/XML
Instead
automatic
procedures
for
example
SQL
to
RDF
converters
for
relational
databases
GRDDL
processors
for
XHTML
files
with
microformats
RDFa
etc
can
produce
RDF
data
on-the-fly
as
an
answer
to
eg
queries
RDF
data
may
also
be
included
in
the
data
via
other
tools
e.g
Adobe’s
XMP
data
that
gets
automatically
added
to
JPEG
images
by
Photoshop
Authoring
tools
also
exist
to
develop
eg
ontologies
on
a
high
level
instead
of
editing
the
ontology
files
directly
Of
course
direct
editing
of
RDF
data
is
sometimes
necessary
but
it
can
be
expected
to
become
less
and
less
prevalent
as
smarter
editors
come
to
the
fore
Clearly
lots
of
development
is
still
to
be
done
in
this
area
and
it
is
a
subject
of
active
Research
and
Development
The
goal
is
to
reuse
as
much
as
possible
existing
data
in
its
existing
form
and
minimize
the
RDF
data
that
has
to
be
created
manually

Does
the

require

to
put
all
my

What
about
my
sensitive
data
The
Semantic

provides
an
application
framework
that
extends
the
current
Web
does
not
replace
it
That
also
means
that
the
current

of
firewalls
various
levels
of
protections
encryption
etc
remain
in
place
If
for
whatever
reason
privacy
business
etc
the
data
should
be
kept
behind
the
firewall
on
the
Intranet
rather
than
being
in
the
open
this
just
means
that
that
particular
Semantic
Web
application
operates
on
the
Intranet
This
is
not
unlike
the
development
of
the
traditional
Web
the
usage
of
Web
Services
etc
a
number
of
applications
were
developed
to
be
used
behind
corporate
firewalls
some
of
them
migrated
later
to
the
full

some
other
stayed
behind
the
firewall
The
same
is
valid
for
Semantic

applications

overview
of
most
of
those
Obviously
there
is
room
for
improvement
SW
is
a
younger
technology
than
XML
and
it
still
needs
time
to
catch
up
and
have
tools
of
the
same
maturity
and
efficiency
level
than
the
XML

However
huge
improvements
have
already
been
made
in
the
past
few
years
in
all
areas
and
large-scale
enterprise
deployment
is
also
happening
already
In
general
availability
of

is
not
a
reason

How
do
I
put
RDF
into
my
X)HTML
Pages
The
GRDDL
provides
a
bridge
to
the
microformats
approach
while
RDFa
provides
an
XHTML

module
that
gives
the
possibility
to
use
virtually
any
RDF
vocabulary
as

of
the
mapping
from

is
usually
described
for
a

using
either
a
small

Questions
on
RDF
Ontologies
SPARQL
Rules
What
is
RDF
RDF—the
Resource
Description
Framework—is
a
standard
model
for
data
interchange
on
the
Web
RDF
has
features
that
facilitate
data
merging
even
if
the
underlying
schemas
differ
and
it
specifically
supports
the
evolution
of
schemas
over
time
without
requiring
all
the
data
consumers
to
be
changed
RDF
extends
the
linking
structure
of
the
Web
to
use
URIs
to
name
the
relationship
between
things
as
well
as
the
two
ends
of
the
link
this
is
usually
referred
to
as
a
triple
Using
this
simple
model
it
allows
structured
and
semi-structured
data
to
be
mixed
exposed
and
shared
across
different
applications
This
linking
structure
forms
a
directed
labelled
graph
where
the
edges
represent
the
named
link
between
two
resources
represented
by
the
graph
nodes
This
graph
view
is
the
easiest
possible
mental
model
for
RDF
and
is
often
used
in
easy-to-understand
visual
explanations
The
RDF
Primer
is
a
good
material
for
further
reading
on
RDF
permalink
What
formats
can
RDF
be
represented
in
RDF
statements
or
triples
can
be
encoded
in
a
number
of
different
formats
whether
XML
based
e.g
RDF/XML
or
not
Turtle
N-triples
In
general
it
does
not
really
matter
which
of
these
formats
or
serializations
are
used
to
express
data—the
information
is
represented
in
RDF
triples
and
the
particular
format
is
only
the
syntactic
sugar
Most
RDF
tools
can
parse
several
of
these
serialization
formats
Compare
to
numbers
as
opposed
to
numerals
Numbers
are
mathematical
concepts
numerals
are
a
representation
thereof
using
Roman
Arabic
hexadecimal
octal
etc
representations
Some
of
those
representations
like
Roman
may
be
very
complicated
some
of
those
may
be
simpler
or
more
familiar
but
they
all
represent
the
same
abstract
concept
permalink
Isn’t
RDF
simply
an
XML
application
No
The
fundamental
model
of
RDF
is
independent
of
XML
RDF
is
a
model
describing
qualified
or
named
relationships
between
two
Web
resources
or
between
a
Web
resource
and
a
literal
At
that
fundamental
level
the
only
commonality
between
RDF
and
the
XML
World
is
the
usage
of
the
XML
Schema
datatypes
to
characterize
literals
in
RDF
In
fact
using
GRDDL
a
way
to
automate
mappings
from
XML
to
RDF
easily
many
XML
vocabularies
can
be
considered
applications
of
RDF
Note
that
one
of
the
serialization
formats
of
RDF
is
indeed
based
on
XML
RDF/XML
and
this
is
probably
the
most
widely
used
format
today
But
others
exist
see
the
separate
question
on
RDF
representation
permalink
Where
is
the
Web
in
the
Semantic
Web
The
Semantic
Web
standards
follow
the
design
principles
of
the
Web
in
order
to
allow
the
growth
of
a
planet-wide
collection
of
semantically-rich
data
The
key
element
of
this
design
is
the
use
of
Web
addresses
URIs
to
name
things
Because
the
meaning
of
a
term
in
a
language
without
central
control
becomes
established
by
its
consistent
use
to
achieve
the
same
effect
and
URIs
are
used
around
the
World
to
access
web
pages
the
Web
is
used
to
establish
globally-shared
meaning
for
URIs
in
the
Semantic
Web
This
is
what
people
mean
when
they
say
RDF
URIs
are
grounded
in
the
Web
As
with
the
Web
in
general
this
approach
allows
the
Semantic
Web
to
grow
and
evolve
without
any
central
control
or
authority
but
while
still
maintaining
as
much
consistency
and
authorial
control
as
needed
for
particular
applications
or
particular
enterprises
The
techniques
for
doing
all
this
are
still
evolving
but
ideally
whenever
anyone
sees
a
Semantic
Web
URI
they
can
use
it
in
their
browser
and
see
authoritative
documentation
about
its
use
Moreover
whenever
some
software
encounters
a
URI
in
a
Semantic
Web
context
it
can
dereference
it
and
find
an
ontology
which
precisely
specifies
how
the
term
is
related
to
other
terms
The
software
may
thus
learn
and
exploit
new
terms
which
are
synonymous
with
terms
it
already
knows
or
related
in
more
complex
and
useful
but
logically
precise
ways
All
this
results
in
the
ability
to
find
and
correctly
merge
data
from
multiple
sources
sometimes
even
when
they
are
provided
with
different
ontologies
In
the
Semantic
Web
it
is
not
the
Semantic
which
is
new
it
is
the
Web
which
is
new

How
can
I
query
RDF
data
The
W
3
C
Data
Access
Working
Group
has
developed
the
SPARQL
Query
Language
SPARQL
defines
queries
in
terms
of
graph
patterns
that
are
matched
against
the
directed
graph
representing
the
RDF
data
SPARQL
contains
capabilities
for
querying
required
and
optional
graph
patterns
along
with
their
conjunctions
and
disjunctions
The
result
of
the
match
can
also
be
used
to
construct
new
RDF
graphs
using
separate
graph
patterns
SPARQL
can
be
used
as
part
of
a
general
programming
environment
like
Jena
but
queries
can
also
be
sent
as
messages
to
a
remote
SPARQL
endpoints
using
the
companion
technologies
SPARQL
Protocol
and
SPARQL
Query
Result
in
XML
Using
such
SPARQL
endpoints
applications
can
query
remote
RDF
data
and
even
construct
new
RDF
graphs
without
any
local
processing
or
programming
burden
For
more
questions
on
SPARQL

the
separate
FAQ

SPARQL

Why
not
use
SQL
and/or
XQuery
to
query
RDF
data
Why
develop
yet
another
query
language
SPARQL
is
a
query
language
developed
for
the
RDF
data
model
queries
themselves
look
and
act
like
RDF
I.e
the
queries
are
independent
of
the
physical
representation
of
the
RDF
data
the
structure
of
the
databases
their
representation
in
an
RDF/XML
file
etc
If
query
was
done
via
for
example
XQuery
the
application
would
have
to
know
how
that
particular
RDF
data
exactly
represented
as
RDF/XML
and
RDF/XML
is
only
one
of
the
possible
serialization
of
the
RDF
data
permalink
Can
I
use
SPARQL
to
insert
delete
or
update
RDF
data
The
current
standardized
version
of
SPARQL
deals
only
with
retrieving
selected
data
from
RDF
graphs
There
is
no
equivalent
of
the
SQL
INSERT
UPDATE
or
DELETE
statements
Most
RDF-based
applications
handle
new
changing
and
stale
data
directly
via
the
APIs
provided
by
specific
RDF
storage
systems
Alternatively
RDF
data
can
exist
virtually
i.e
created
on-demand
in
response
to
a
SPARQL
query
Also
there
are
systems
which
create
RDF
data
from
other
forms
of
markup
such
as
Wiki
markup
or
the
Atom
Syndication
Format
However
there
is
indeed
demand
to
cover
this
functionality
too
The
SPARQL
Working
Group
is
currently
active
in
developing
a
new
version
of
SPARQL
and
this
will
include
these
facilities
too

first
draft
version
of
the
SPARQL

there

Next
When
will
feature
X
be
standardized
SPARQL
users
have
asked
for
many
extensions
to
the
SPARQL
query
language
Some
of
these
have
been
accomodated
by
SPARQL
implementations
In
an
attempt
to
inform
SPARQL
users
and
to
minimize
implementation
differences
of
non-standard
SPARQL
features
a
new
SPARQL
Working
Group
has
been
set
up
early
2009
This
group
is
busy
defining
the
minimal
number
of
extensions
that
can
be
done
without
backward
incompatibilities
and
do
not
require
a
too
large
addition
to
the
initial
version
of
SPARQL
The
first
drafts
have
been
published
in
October
2009
and
the
work
is
planned
to
be
completed
resulting
in
an
updated

What
role
do
ontologies
and/or
rules
have
on
the
Semantic
Web
On
the
Semantic
Web
both
ontologies
and
rules
are
used
to
express
extra
constraints
and
logical
relationships
among
resources
An
example
for
their
usage
is
to
help
data
integration
when
for
example
different
terms
are
used
to
describe
the
same
thing
in
different
data
sets
or
when
a
bit
of
extra
knowledge
may
lead
to
the
discovery
of
new
relationships
Ontologies
and
rules
refer
to
two
different
traditions
stemming
from
logic
as
developed
in
the
past
decades
Whereas
ontologies
are
more
closely
related
to
classification
systems
and
particularly
to
description
logic
rules
rely
more
on
the
advances
of
logic
programming
and
rule
based
systems
See
the
separate
questions
on
Ontologies
and
on
Rules
permalink
What
are
ontologies
in
the
Semantic
Web
context
Ontologies
define
the
concepts
and
relationships
used
to
describe
and
represent
an
area
of
knowledge
Ontologies
are
used
to
classify
the
terms
used
in
a
particular
application
characterize
possible
relationships
and
define
possible
constraints
on
using
those
relationships
In
practice
ontologies
can
be
very
complex
with
several
thousands
of
terms
or
very
simple
describing
one
or
two
concepts
only
An
example
for
the
role
of
ontologies
or
rules
on
the
Semantic
Web
is
to
help
data
integration
when
for
example
ambiguities
may
exist
on
the
terms
used
in
the
different
data
sets
or
when
a
bit
of
extra
knowledge
may
lead
to
the
discovery
of
new
relationships
A
general
example
may
help
A
bookseller
may
want
to
integrate
data
coming
from
different
publishers
The
data
can
be
imported
into
a
common
RDF
model
eg
by
using
converters
to
the
publishers
databases
However
one
database
may
use
the
term

the
other

complete

should
be
added
to

that
the

the

as

extra
piece
of
information
is
in
fact
an
ontology

an
extremely
simple
one

What
are
rules
on
the
Semantic
Web
The
term
rules
in
the
context
of
the
Semantic
Web
refers
to
elements
of
logic
programming
and
rule
based
systems
bound
to
Semantic
Web
data
Rules
offer
a
way
to
express
for
example
constraints
on
the
relationships
defined
by
by
RDF
or
may
be
used
to
discover
new
implicit
relationships
Various
rule
systems
production
rules
Prolog-like
systems
etc
are
very
different
from
one
another
and
it
is
not
possible
to
define
one
rule
language
to
encompass
them
all
However
it
is
possible
to
define
a
core
that
is
essentially
understood
by
all
rule
systems
This
core
is
based
on
restricted
kind
of
rule
called
a
Horn
rule
which
like
most
rules
has
the
form
if
conditions
then
consequence
but
it
places
certain
restrictions
on
the
kinds
of
conditions
and
consequences
that
can
be
used
A
general
example
may
help
While
integrating
data
coming
from
different
sources
the
data
may
include
references
to
persons
their
name
homepage
email
addresses
etc
However
the
data
does
not
say
when
two
persons
should
be
considered
as
identical
although
this
is
clearly
important
for
a
full
integration
An
extra
condition
can
be
expressed
stating
that
if
two
persons
have
similar
names
home
pages
and
email
addresses
then
they
are
identical
Such
condition
can
be
naturally
expressed
with
Horn
rules
The
Rule
Interchange
Format
RIF
Working
Group
is
currently
working
on
a
precise
definition
of
this
core
Rule
language
on
ways
to
extend
this
rule
language
to
various
variants
production
rules
logic
programming
etc
to
exchange
expression
of
rules
among
systems
and
to
define
the
precise
relationships
of
these
rules
with
OWL
ontologies
and
their
usage
with
RDF
triples

How
do
I
know
when
to
use
OWL
and
when
to
Rules
How
can
I
use
them
both
together
First
of
all
the
question
arises
whether
it
is
possible
to
use
these
two
technologies
together
The
answer
is
yes
One
of
the
six
recommendation
track
documents
of
RIF
is
called
RIF
RDF
and
OWL
Compatibility
In
layman’s
term
what
it
describes
is
how
the
two
sides
i.e
the
rule
and
the
classification
sides
should
work
together
on
the
same
data
set
It
defines
some
sort
of
an
interplay
between
two
different
mechanisms
the
shall
we
say
logic
programming
part
and
the
knowledge
representation
part
Implementations
doing
both
are
a
bit
like
hybrid
cars
they
have
two
parallel
engines
and
a
well
defined
connections
between
those
two
That
said
the
document
only
defines
what
the
combination
means
whether
for
example
engines
will
always
succeed
in
handling
the
two
worlds
together
in
a
finite
time
is
not
necessarily
guaranteed
in
all
cases
But
we
can
be
positive
in
many
cases
ie
by
accepting
restrictions
here
and
there
this
combination
does
work
well
and
there
are
actually
good
implementations
out
there
that
do
just
that
The
substantive
differences
is
that
RIF
i.e
logic
programming
and
OWL
are
designed
to
allow
for
optimizations
of
different
sets
of
problems
Very
broadly
speaking
OWL
optimizes
for
taxonomic
reasoning
problems
within
an
ontology
specification
i.e
without
the
data
and
logic
programs
optimize
for
reasoning
problems
within
the
data
i.e
without
the
ontology
So
a
reasonable
rule
of
thumb
is
if
one’s
ontology
is
very
large
one
should
probably
use
OWL
and
if
data
set
is
very
large
one
should
probably
use
RIF
That
being
said
the
expressive
differences
are
quite
minor
and
it
very
often
boils
down
to
personal
experience
and
taste
some
feel
more
comfortable
using
rules
while
others
prefer
knowledge
representation

What
is
inference
on
the
Semantic
Web
Broadly
speaking
inference
on
the
Semantic
Web
can
be
characterized
by
discovering
new
relationships
As
described
elsewhere
in
this
FAQ
the
data
is
modeled
as
a
set
of
named
relationships
between
resources
Inference
means
that
automatic
procedures
can
generate
new
relationships
based
on
the
data
and
based
on
some
additional
information
in
the
form
of
an
ontology
or
a
set
of
rules
Whether
the
new
relationships
are
explicitly
added
to
the
set
of
data
or
are
returned
at
query
time
is
simply
an
implementation
issue
A
simple
example
may
help
The
data
set
to
be
considered
may
include
the
relationship
Flipper
isA
Dolphin
An
ontology
may
declare
that
every
Dolphin
is
also
a
Mammal
That
means
that
a
Semantic
Web
program
understanding
the
notion
of
X
is
also
Y
can
add
to
the
set
of
relationships
the
statement
Flipper
isA
Mammal
although
that
was
not
part
of
the
original
data
One
can
also
say
that
the
new
relationship
was
discovered

Must
I
use
ontologies
for
Semantic
Web
Applications
It
depends
on
the
application
The
answer
on
the
role
of
ontologies
and/or
rules
includes
a
very
simple
ontology
example
Some
applications
may
decide
not
to
use
even
such
small
ontologies
and
rely
on
the
logic
of
the
application
program
Some
application
may
choose
to
use
very
simple
ontologies
like
the
one
described
and
let
a
general
Semantic
Web
environment
use
that
extra
information
to
make
the
identification
of
the
terms
Some
applications
need
an
agreement
on
common
terminologies
without
any
rigor
imposed
by
a
logic
system
Finally
some
applications
may
need
more
complex
ontologies
with
complex
reasoning
procedures
It
all
depends
on
the
requirements
and
the
goals
of
the
applications
The
current
Semantic
Web
technologies
offer
a
large
palette
of
languages
to
describe
simple
or
complex
terminologies
RDF
Schemas
SKOS
RIF
or
various
dialects/profiles
of
OWL
OWL
DL
OWL
2
QL
OWL

EL
OWL

RL
OWL
Full
These
technologies
differ
in
expressiveness
but
also
in
complexity
Applications
have
a
choice
along
a
range
from
RDF
Schema
for
representing
the
simplest
ontology
level
to
OWL
Full
for
maximum
expressiveness
In
addition
semantic
web
users
are
encouraged
to
leverage
existing
ontologies
where
possible
e.g
SKOS
for
representing
basic
structures
like
thesauri
taxonomies
or
other
controlled
vocabularies
Good
places
to
look
for
existing
ontologies
are
detailed
elsewhere
in
this
FAQ
They
also
have
a
choice
of
not
to
use
any
of
those
the
usage
of
ontologies
is
not
a
requirement
for
Semantic
Web
applications
permalink
Does
the
Semantic
Web
try
to
impose
meaning
from
the
top
No
What
the
Semantic
Web
technologies
do
is
to
define
the
language
with
well
understood
rules
and
internal
semantics
ie
RDF
Schemas
various
dialects
of
OWL
or
SKOS
Which
of
those
formalisms
are
used
if
any
and
what
is
expressed
in
those
language
is
entirely
up
to
the
applications
Ontologies
may
be
developed
by
small
communities
from
below
so
to
say
and
shared
with
other
communities
permalink
Does
the
Semantic
Web
require
everybody
to
subscribe
to
a
single
predefined
giant
ontology
Obviously
that
would
not
be
feasible
If
ontologies
are
used
they
can
come
from
anywhere
and
be
mixed
freely
In
fact
the
ethos
of
the
Semantic
Web
is
to
share
and
reuse
as
much
as
possible
and
lot
of
work
is
done
to
semi-automatically
bridge
different
vocabularies
Typical
Semantic
Web
applications
mix
ontologies
developed
by
different
communities
on
the
Web
like
the
Dublin
Core
metadata
FOAF
friend-of-a-friend
terms
etc
The
Semantic
Web’s
attitude
to
ontologies
is
no
more
than
a
rationalization
of
actual
data-sharing
practice
Applications
can
and
do
interact
without
achieving
or
attempting
to
achieve
global
consistency
and
coverage
A
system
that
presents
a
retailer’s
wares
to
customers
will
harvest
information
from
suppliers
databases
themselves
likely
to
use
heterogeneous
formats
and
map
it
onto
the
retailer’s
preferred
data
format
for
re-presentation
Automatic
tax
return
software
takes
bank
data
in
the
bank’s
preferred
format
and
maps
them
onto
the
tax
form
There
is
no
requirement
for
global
ontologies
here
There
isn’t
even
a
requirement
for
agreement
or
global
translations
between
the
specific
ontologies
being
used
except
in
the
subset
of
terms
relevant
for
the
particular
transaction
Agreement
need
only
be
local
but
adoption
of
vocabularies
from
existing
ontologies
facilitates
data
sharing
and
integration
Of
course
some
of
the
vocabularies
may
become
more
and
more
widely
used
and
adopted
but
the
evolution
is
more
bottom-up
rather
than
top-down
permalink
People
will
never
get
common
agreement
on
terms
won’t
this
lead
to
the
failure
of
the
Semantic
Web
The
issue
referred
to
by
this
question
is
that
different
people
will
not
agree
on
exactly
how
to
define
all
concepts
Eg
while
most
people
have
a
fairly
standard
concept
of
a
dog
or
a
cat
not
everyone
can
distinguish
between
a
scalar
and
a
vector
for
instance
Any
computer
application
which
tries
to
standardize
its
ontology
will
necessarily
distort
what
at
least
some
people
are
really
trying
to
express
as
a
consequence
there
will
be
ontological
mismatches
across
parts
of
the
Web
designed
by
different
people
The
issue
is
whether
this
may
not
ruin
the
very
goals
of
the
Semantic
Web
However
the
Semantic
Web
does
not
rely
on
having
one
big
all-encompassing
ontology
Instead
the
Semantic
Web
is
built
up
from
small
like-minded
communities
that
can
find
agreement
on
terms
amongst
themselves
Applications
then
can
and
do
interact
without
attempting
to
achieve
global
consensus
There
is
no
requirement
for
global
ontologies
instead
an
application
need
only
map
the
terms
relevant
for
a
particular
transaction
into
a
common
vocabulary
Of
course
though
agreement
need
only
be
local
adoption
of
existing
vocabularies
facilitates
data
sharing
and
integration
Note
that
this
issue
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
one
asking
whether
the
Semantic
Web
requires
everybody
to
subscribe
to
a
single
predefined
giant
ontology

What
is
involved
in
developing
an
ontology
using
Semantic
Web
technologies
The
real
difficulty
when
developing
an
ontology
is
to
understand
the
problem
that
has
to
be
modeled
and
find
an
agreement
on
a
community
level
RDF
Schemas
and/or
OWL
provide
a
framework
to
formalize
those
ontologies
in
a
specific
language
the
time
and
energy
needed
to
learn
and
use
them
is
only
a
fraction
of
the
time
needed
to
develop
an
ontology
itself
ie
understand
the
terms
and
the
relationships
of
given
area
of
knowledge
and
agree
with
your
peers
Ontology

like
Protégé
or

of
the
syntax

Consequences
of
inconsistency
in
formal
logic
doesn’t
that
ruin
the
Semantic
Web
The
problem
referred
to
by
this
question
is
the
fact
that
in
formal
logic
if
there
is
an
inconsitency
somewhere
then
it
is
possible
to
draw
all
conclusions
and
their
negations
The
issue
is
whether
this
would
not
create
major
difficulties
on
the
Semantic
Web
Inference
in
terms
of
the
Semantic
Web
can
be
characterized
by
discovering
new
relationships
as
explained
in
the
answer
of
another
question
These
inferences
are
mostly
done
within
a
restricted
guarded
subset
of
first
order
logic
Usually
reasoning
on
the
Semantic
Web
does
not
use
the
full
power
of
first
order
or
higher
order
logic
and
therefore
avoids
some
of
the
dangerous
issues
that
can
come
from
an
inferred
inconsistency
In
other
words
in
practice
no
major
difficulties
can
be
expected

What
is
SKOS
The
Simple
Knowledge
Organization
System
SKOS
is
an
ontology
for
expressing
the
basic
structure
and
content
of
concept
schemes
such
as
thesauri
classification
schemes
subject
heading
lists
taxonomies
glossaries
folksonomies
other
types
of
controlled
vocabularies
It
provides
a
standard
low-cost
way
of
migrating
existing
concept
schemes
to
the
Semantic
Web
so
that
they
can
be
used
as-is
for
the
development
of
lightweight
Semantic
Web
applications
SKOS
is
increasingly
seen
as
a
bridging
technology
providing
the
missing
link
between
the
rigorous
logical
formalism
of
ontology
languages
such
as
OWL
and
the
chaotic
informal
and
weakly-structured
world
of
social
approaches
to

Abstract
As
more
information
becomes
available
on
the
World
Wide
Web
there
are
currently
over
4
billion
pages
covering
most
areas
of
human
endeavor
it
becomes
more
difficult
to
provide
effective
search
tools
for
information
access
Today
people
access
web
information
through
two
main
kinds
of

The

There
appears
to
be
a
need
for
systems
that
do
reasoning
under
uncertainty
and
are
flexible
enough
to
recover
from
the
contradictions
inconsistencies
and
irregularities
that
such
reasoning
involves
Active
Logic
is
a
formalism
that
has
been
developed
with
real-world
applications
and
their
challenges
in
mind
Motivating
its
design
is
the
thought
that
one
of
the
factors
that
supports
the
flexibility
of
human
reasoning
is
that
it
takes
place
step-wise
in
time
Active
Logic
is
one
of
a
family
of
inference
engines
step-logics
that
explicitly
reason
in
time
and
incorporate
a
history
of
their
reasoning
as
they
run
This
characteristic
makes
Active
Logic
systems
more
flexible
than
traditional
AI
systems
and
therefore
more
suitable
for
commonsense

reasoning

What
is
Oracle
WebLogic
Server
Oracle
WebLogic
Server
is
a
leading
e-commerce
online
transaction
processing
OLTP
platform
developed
to
connect
users
in
distributed
computing
production
environments
and
to
facilitate
the
integration
of
mainframe
applications
with
distributed
corporate
data
and
applications
WebLogic
is
an
Application
Server
that
runs
on
a
middle
tier
between
back-end
databases
and
related
applications
and
browser-based
thin
clients
WebLogic
Server
mediates
the
exchange
of
requests
from
the
client
tier
with
responses
from
the
back-end
tier
Oracle
WebLogic

architecture
Oracle
WebLogic
Server
operates
as
middleware
for
distributed
enterprise
applications
WebLogic
Server
is
based
on
Java
Platform
Enterprise
Edition
Java
EE
formerly
known
as
Java
2
Platform
Enterprise
Edition
or
J
2
EE
the
standard
platform
used
to
create
Java-based
multi-tier
enterprise
applications
Java
EE
platform
technologies
were
developed
through
the
efforts
of
BEA
Systems
and
other
vendors
in
collaboration
with
the
main
developer
Sun
Microsystems
Because
Java
EE
applications
are
standardized
modules
WebLogic
can
automate
many
system-level
tasks
that
would
otherwise
have
demanded
programming
time
What
is

is
a
component
of
Oracle's
Fusion
middleware
platform
The
main
features
of
WebLogic
server
include
the
following
connectors
that
make
it
possible
for
any
legacy
application
on
any
client
to
interoperate
with
server
applications
Enterprise

includes
features
such
as
Secure

support
for
the
encryption
of
data
transmissions
and
authentication
and
Authorization
mechanisms
to
make

secure
WebLogic
server
architecture
A
WebLogic
server
installation
includes
at
least
one
WebLogic
server
instance
but
may
include
multiple
server
instances
on
one
or
more
separate
computer
servers
Multiple
WebLogic
servers
are
administered
together
as
a
unit
called
a
domain
Each
WebLogic
domain
includes
a
single
administration
server
and
may
contain
additional
server
instances
managed
by
the
administration
server
When
these
managed
servers
are
configured
to
be
part
of
a
WebLogic
Server
cluster
they
enable
scaling
for
high-availability
applications
WebLogic
Server
domains
can
also
be
deployed
on
a
public
cloud
using
the
Oracle
Cloud
Infrastructure
Container
Engine

How
popular
is
WebLogic
WebLogic
Server
is
intended
for
high-traffic
applications
so
it
is
not
surprising
that
it
is
not
used
by
many
sites
According
to
W

Techs
Word
Wide
Web
Technology
Surveys
usage
statistics
for
WebLogic
Server
indicate
it
is
used
by
less

of
all
websites
running
a

However

market
share

for
the

sites
As
an
integral
part
of
Oracle's
application

stack
WebLogic
Server
does
not
need
to
be
popular
outside
of

Oracle
WebLogic
Server
vs
Apache
Tomcat
The
Apache
Tomcat
web
server
is
often
compared
with
WebLogic
Server
The
Tomcat
web
server
serves
static
content
and
dynamic
content
in
web
applications
delivered
in
Java
servlets
and
JavaServer
Pages
The
fundamental
difference
between
WebLogic
Server
and
Apache
Tomcat
is
that
WebLogic
is
an
application
server
That
means
WebLogic
includes
components
that
provide
web
services
as
well
as
a
server
environment
for
accessing
enterprise
data
resources
like
databases
and
transaction

What
Is
WebLogic
Oracle
WebLogic
Server
is
a
scalable
enterprise
Java
platform
application
server
for
Java-based
web
applications
The
WebLogic
Server
mediates
the
exchange
of
requests
from
the
client
tier
with
responses
from
the
back-end
tier
WebLogic
allows
users
to
develop
and
deploy
an
application
that
has
business
logic
and
allows
the
application
to
access
other
services
like
database
messaging
or
other
enterprise
systems
It
is
a
robust
platform
for
distributed
applications
Originally
WebLogic
wasn’t
always
in
the
Oracle
portfolio
In
fact
it
joined
the
Oracle
product
portfolio
in
2008
when
BEA
Systems
a
software
company
that
developed
it
was
acquired
by
Oracle
WebLogic
Server
offers
a
robust
highly
available
and
secure
environment
for
critical
applications
What
Is
WebLogic
Used
For
WebLogic
is
a
platform
where
you
deploy
your
Java
application
and
everything
else
is
handled
by
the
server
When
clients
make
a
request
to
a
web
application
the
web
server
will
handle
the
request
and
delegate
its
processing
to
the
required
service
If
the
request
requires
reading
data
for
example
from
the
database
WebLogic
will
take
care
of
it
The
client
doesn't
know
what
happened
in
the
background
and
is
served
with
the
required
content
In
fact
the
server
is
usually
used
in
the
production
environments
where
there
are
many
clients
making
thousands
of
requests
every
time
and
the
server
must
be
able
to
serve
all
of
them
without
any
issues
To
achieve
stability
and
high
availability
usually
load
balancing
and
scalability
is
used
within
the
application
server
The
application
can
be
deployed
to
the
server
in
several
ways
Below
is
the
example
of
deploying
the
application

WebLogic
vs
Tomcat
While
Apache
Tomcat
is
the
most
popular
application
server
it
offers
a
limited
set
of
features
from
the
Jakarta
EE
Full
Profile
specification
such
as
Java
Servlet
or
JavaServer
Pages
For
some
enterprise
applications
however
that
limited
feature
set
might
not
be
enough

Final
Thoughts
If
you
are
considering
a
tool
for
a
production
environment
with
a
heavy
load
and
you
also
need
most
or
all
from
the
Java
EE
specification
WebLogic
is
a
good
candidate
While
there
are
other
servers
that
have
similar
functionality
one
of
the
advantages
of
WebLogic
is
its
excellent
integration
with
other
products
from
Oracle
WebLogic
Server
is
a
commercial
product
that
requires
buying
a
license
but
you
will
get
access
to
enterprise
support
as
well
Due
to
all
its
features
WebLogic
isn’t
really
a
lightweight
solution
so
make
sure
you
compare
the
servers
well
before
choosing
for
one
including
redeploy
times
Fortunately
there's
a
solution
to
long
redeploy
times
With
JRebel
you
can
eliminate
redeploys
in
any
application
server
and
IDE
while
maintaining
application
state
These
time
savings
are
more
than
just
spare
minutes
they
add
up
to
real
business
value

Issue
in
artificial
intelligence
and
categorical
algebra
In
artificial
intelligence
with
implications
for
cognitive
science
the
frame
problem
describes
an
issue
with
using
first-order
logic
to
express
facts
about
a
robot
in
the
world
Representing
the
state
of
a
robot
with
traditional
first-order
logic
requires
the
use
of
many
axioms
that
simply
imply
that
things
in
the
environment
do
not
change
arbitrarily
For
example
Hayes
describes
a
block
world
with
rules
about
stacking
blocks
together
In
a
first-order
logic
system
additional
axioms
are
required
to
make
inferences
about
the
environment
for
example
that
a
block
cannot
change
position
unless
it
is
physically
moved
The
frame
problem
is
the
problem
of
finding
adequate
collections
of
axioms
for
a
viable
description
of
a
robot
environment
1
John
McCarthy
and
Patrick
J
Hayes
defined
this
problem
in
their
1969
article
Some
Philosophical
Problems
from
the
Standpoint
of
Artificial
Intelligence
In
this
paper
and
many
that
came
after
the
formal
mathematical
problem
was
a
starting
point
for
more
general
discussions
of
the
difficulty
of
knowledge
representation
for
artificial
intelligence
Issues
such
as
how
to
provide
rational
default
assumptions
and
what
humans
consider
common
sense
in
a
virtual
environment
2
In
philosophy
the
frame
problem
became
more
broadly
construed
in
connection
with
the
problem
of
limiting
the
beliefs
that
have
to
be
updated
in
response
to
actions
In
the
logical
context
actions
are
typically
specified
by
what
they
change
with
the
implicit
assumption
that
everything
else
the
frame
remains
unchanged
Description
edit
The
frame
problem
occurs
even
in
very
simple
domains
A
scenario
with
a
door
which
can
be
open
or
closed
and
a
light
which
can
be
on
or
off
is
statically
represented
by
two
propositions

The
frame
problem
is
that
specifying
only
which
conditions
are
changed
by
the
actions
does
not
entail
that
all
other
conditions
are
not
changed
This
problem
can
be
solved
by
adding
the
so-called
frame
axioms
which
explicitly
specify
that
all
conditions
not
affected
by
actions
are
not
changed
while
executing
that
action
For
example
since
the
action
executed
at
time
0
is
that
of
opening
the
door
a
frame
axiom
would
state
that
the
status
of
the
light
does
not
change
from
time
0
to
time

The
frame
problem
is
that
one
such
frame
axiom
is
necessary
for
every
pair
of
action
and
condition
such
that
the
action
does
not
affect
the
condition
clarification
needed
In
other
words
the
problem
is
that
of
formalizing
a
dynamical
domain
without
explicitly
specifying
the
frame
axioms
The
solution
proposed
by
McCarthy
to
solve
this
problem
involves
assuming
that
a
minimal
amount
of
condition
changes
have
occurred
this
solution
is
formalized
using
the
framework
of
circumscription
The
Yale
shooting
problem
however
shows
that
this
solution
is
not
always
correct
Alternative
solutions
were
then
proposed
involving
predicate
completion
fluent
occlusion
successor
state
axioms
etc
they
are
explained
below
By
the
end
of
the
1980
s
the
frame
problem
as
defined
by
McCarthy
and
Hayes
was
solved
clarification
needed
Even
after
that
however
the
term
frame
problem
was
still
used
in
part
to
refer
to
the
same
problem
but
under
different
settings
e.g
concurrent
actions
and
in
part
to
refer
to
the
general
problem
of
representing
and
reasoning
with
dynamical
domains
Solutions
edit
The
following
solutions
depict
how
the
frame
problem
is
solved
in
various
formalisms
The
formalisms
themselves
are
not
presented
in
full
what
is
presented
are
simplified
versions
that
are
sufficient
to
explain
the
full
solution
Fluent
occlusion
solution
edit
This
solution
was
proposed
by
Erik
Sandewall
who
also
defined
a
formal
language
for
the
specification
of
dynamical
domains
therefore
such
a
domain
can
be
first
expressed
in
this
language
and
then
automatically
translated
into
logic
In
this
article
only
the
expression
in
logic
is
shown
and
only
in
the
simplified
language
with
no
action
names
The
rationale
of
this
solution
is
to
represent
not
only
the
value
of
conditions
over
time
but
also
whether
they
can
be
affected
by
the
last
executed
action
The
latter
is
represented
by
another
condition
called
occlusion
A
condition
is
said
to
be
occluded
in
a
given
time
point
if
an
action
has
been
just
executed
that
makes
the
condition
true
or
false
as
an
effect
Occlusion
can
be
viewed
as
permission
to
change
if
a
condition
is
occluded
it
is
relieved
from
obeying
the
constraint
of
inertia
In
the
simplified
example
of
the
door
and
the
light
occlusion
can
be
formalized
by
two
predicates

The
rationale
is
that

condition
can

value
only
if
the

is
true
at

point
In

The

after

of
an
action
can

determined
by
the
fact
that
the
condition
is
true

if
1
the
action
makes
the
condition
true
or
2
the
condition
was

and
the
action
does
not
make
it
false
A
successor

axiom
is
a

This
solution
is
centered
around
the
value
of
conditions
rather
than
the
effects
of
actions
In
other
words
there
is
an
axiom
for
every
condition
rather
than
a
formula
for
every
action
Preconditions
to
actions
which
are
not
present
in
this
example
are
formalized
by
other
formulae
The
successor
state
axioms
are
used
in
the
variant
to
the
situation
calculus
proposed
by
Ray
Reiter
Fluent
calculus
solution
edit
The
fluent
calculus
is
a
variant
of
the
situation
calculus
It
solves
the
frame
problem
by
using
first-order
logic
terms
rather
than
predicates
to
represent
the
states
Converting
predicates
into
terms
in
first-order
logic
is
called
reification
the
fluent
calculus
can
be
seen
as
a
logic
in
which
predicates
representing
the
state
of
conditions
are
reified
The
difference
between
a
predicate
and
a
term
in
first-order
logic
is
that
a
term
is
a
representation
of
an
object
possibly
a
complex
object
composed
of
other
objects
while
a
predicate
represents
a
condition
that
can
be
true
or
false
when
evaluated
over
a
given
set
of
terms
In
the
fluent
calculus
each
possible
state
is
represented
by
a
term
obtained
by
composition
of
other
terms
each
one
representing
the
conditions
that
are
true
in
state
For
example
the
state
in
which
the
door
is
open
and
the
light
is
on
is
represented
by
the
term

The
solution
to

is
to
specify
the

of
actions
by
stating
how
a

changes
when
the
action
is
executed

Event
calculus
solution
edit
The
event
calculus
uses
terms
for
representing
fluents
like
the
fluent
calculus
but
also
has
one
or
more
axioms
constraining
the
value
of
fluents
like
the
successor
state
axioms
There
are
many
variants
of
the
event
calculus
but
one
of
the
simplest
and
most
useful
employs
a
single
axiom
to
represent
the
law
of
inertia

The

eliminating

solutions
by
using

non-monotonic
logic

or
by

as
a

Separation

is
an
extension
of
Hoare
logic
oriented
to
reasoning
about
mutable
data
structures
in
computer
memory
and
other
dynamic
resources
and
it
has
a
special
connective
pronounced
and
separately
to
support
independent
reasoning
about
disjoint
memory
regions

Separation
logic
employs
a
tight
interpretation
of
pre/post
specs
which
say
that
the
code
can
only
access
memory
locations
guaranteed
to
exist
by
the
precondition

This
leads
to
the
soundness
of
the

of

The
semantics
of
an
action
description
language
depends
on
what
the
language
can
express
concurrent
actions
delayed
effects
etc
and
is
usually
based
on
transition
systems
Since
domains
are
expressed
in
these
languages
rather
than
directly
in
logic
the
frame
problem
only
arises
when
a
specification
given
in
an
action
description
logic
is
to
be
translated
into
logic
Typically
however
a
translation
is
given
from
these
languages
to
answer
set
programming
rather
than
first-order
logic

Description
We
propose
an
architecture
for
a
rule-based
online
management
systems
RuleOMS
Typically
many
domain
areas
face
the
problem
that
stakeholders
maintain
databases
of
their
business
core
information
and
they
have
to
take
decisions
or
create
reports
according
to
guidelines
policies
or
regulations
To
address
this
issue
we
propose
the
integration
of
databases
in
particular
relational
databases
with
a
logic
reasoner
and
rule
engine
We
argue
that
defeasible
logic
is
an
appropriate
formalism
to
model
rules
in
particular
when
the
rules
are
meant
to
model
regulations
The
resulting
RuleOMS
provides
an
efficient
and
flexible
solution
to
the
problem
at
hand
using
defeasible
inference
A
case
study
of
an
online
child
care
management
system
is
used
to
illustrate
the
proposed
architecture

Church’s
type
theory
aka
simple
type
theory
is
a
formal
logical
language
which
includes
classical
first-order
and
propositional
logic
but
is
more
expressive
in
a
practical
sense
It
is
used
with
some
modifications
and
enhancements
in
most
modern
applications
of
type
theory
It
is
particularly
well
suited
to
the
formalization
of
mathematics
and
other
disciplines
and
to
specifying
and
verifying
hardware
and
software
It
also
plays
an
important
role
in
the
study
of
the
formal
semantics
of
natural
language
And
in
particular
when
used
as
a
metalogic
to
semantically
embed
expressive
quantified
non-classical
logics
it
enables
further
topical
applications
in
artificial
intelligence
and
philosophy
A
great
wealth
of
technical
knowledge
can
be
expressed
very
naturally
in
it
With
possible
enhancements
Church’s
type
theory
constitutes
an
excellent
formal
language
for
representing
the
knowledge
in
automated
information
systems
sophisticated
automated
reasoning
systems
systems
for
verifying
the
correctness
of
mathematical
proofs
and
a
range
of
projects
involving
logic
and
artificial
intelligence

Type
theories
are
also
called
higher-order
logics
since
they
allow
quantification
not
only
over
individual
variables
as
in
first-order
logic
but
also
over
function
predicate
and
even
higher-order
variables
Type
theories
characteristically
assign
types
to
entities
distinguishing
for
example
between
numbers
sets
of
numbers
functions
from
numbers
to
sets
of
numbers
and
sets
of
such
functions
As
illustrated
in
Section
1
2

below
these
distinctions
allow
one
to
discuss
the
conceptually
rich
world
of
sets
and
functions
without
encountering
the
paradoxes
of
naive
set
theory
Church’s
type
theory
is
a
formulation
of
type
theory
that
was
introduced
by
Alonzo
Church
in
Church
1940
In
certain
respects
it
is
simpler
and
more
general
than
the
type
theory
introduced
by
Bertrand
Russell
in
Russell
1908
and
Whitehead
Russell
1927
a
Since
properties
and
relations
can
be
regarded
as
functions
from
entities
to
truth
values
the
concept
of
a
function
is
taken
as
primitive
in
Church’s
type
theory
and
the
λ-notation
which
Church
introduced
in
Church
1932
and
Church
1941
is
incorporated
into
the
formal
language
Moreover
quantifiers
and
description
operators
are
introduced
in
a
way
so
that
additional
binding
mechanisms
can
be
avoided
λ-notation
is
reused
instead
λ-notation
is
thus
the
only
binding
mechanism
employed
in
Church’s
type
theory

Fundamental
Ideas
We
start
with
an
informal
description
of
the
fundamental
ideas
underlying
the
syntax
of
Church’s
formulation
of
type
theory
All
entities
have
types
and
if
α
and
β
are
types
the
type
of
functions
from
elements
of
type
β
to
elements
of
type
α
is
written
as
alpha
beta
This
notation
was
introduced
by
Church
but
some
authors
write
beta
rightarrow
alpha
instead
of
alpha
beta
See
for
example
Section
2
of
the
entry
on
type
theory
As
noted
by
Schönfinkel
1924
functions
of
more
than
one
argument
can
be
represented
in
terms
of
functions
of
one
argument
when
the
values
of
these
functions
can
themselves
be
functions
For
example
if
f
is
a
function
of
two
arguments
for
each
element
x
of
the
left
domain
of
f
there
is
a
function
g
depending
on
x
such
that
gy
fxy
for
each
element
y
of
the
right
domain
of
f
We
may
now
write
g
fx
and
regard
f
as
a
function
of
a
single
argument
whose
value
for
any
argument
x
in
its
domain
is
a
function
fx
whose
value
for
any
argument
y
in
its
domain
is
fxy
For
a
more
explicit
example
consider
the
function
which
carries
any
pair
of
natural
numbers
to
their
sum
We
may
denote
this
function
by
sigma
sigma
sigma
where
sigma
is
the
type
of
natural
numbers
Given
any
number
x
sigma
sigma
sigma
x
is
the
function
which
when
applied
to
any
number
y
gives
the
value
sigma
sigma
sigma
x]y
which
is
ordinarily
abbreviated
as
x
y
Thus
sigma
sigma
sigma
x
is
the
function
of
one
argument
which
adds
x
to
any
number
When
we
think
of
sigma
sigma
sigma
as
a
function
of
one
argument
we
see
that
it
maps
any
number
x
to
the
function
sigma
sigma
sigma
x
More
generally
if
f
is
a
function
which
maps
n-tuples
langle
w
beta
x
gamma
ldots
y
delta
z
tau
rangle
of
elements
of
types
beta
gamma
delta
tau
respectively
to
elements
of
type
α
we
may
assign
to
f
the
type
ldots
alpha
tau
delta
ldots
gamma
beta
It
is
customary
to
use
the
convention
of
association
to
the
left
to
omit
parentheses
and
write
this
type
symbol
simply
as
alpha
tau
delta
ldots
gamma
beta
A
set
or
property
can
be
represented
by
a
function
often
called
characteristic
function
which
maps
elements
to
truth
values
so
that
an
element
is
in
the
set
or
has
the
property
in
question
iff
the
function
representing
the
set
or
property
maps
that
element
to
truth
When
a
statement
is
asserted
the
speaker
means
that
it
is
true
so
that
s
x
means
that
s
x
is
true
which
also
expresses
the
assertions
that
s
maps
x
to
truth
and
that
x
in
s
In
other
words
x
in
s
iff
s
x
We
take
o
as
the
type
symbol
denoting
the
type
of
truth
values
so
we
may
speak
of
any
function
of
type
o
alpha
as
a
set
of
elements
of
type
α
A
function
of
type
o
alpha
beta
is
a
binary
relation
between
elements
of
type
β
and
elements
of
type
α
For
example
if
sigma
is
the
type
of
the
natural
numbers
and
is
the
order
relation
between
natural
numbers
has
type
o
sigma
sigma
and
for
all
natural
numbers
x
and
y
x
y
which
we
ordinarily
write
as
x
y
has
the
value
truth
iff
x
is
less
than
y
Of
course
can
also
be
regarded
as
the
function
which
maps
each
natural
number
x
to
the
set
x
of
all
natural
numbers
y
such
that
x
is
less
than
y
Thus
sets
properties
and
relations
may
be
regarded
as
particular
kinds
of
functions
Church’s
type
type
theory
is
thus
a
logic
of
functions
and
in
this
sense
it
is
in
the
tradition
of
the
work
of
Frege’s
Begriffsschrift
The
opposite
approach
would
be
to
reduce
functions
to
relations
which
was
the
approach
taken
by
Whitehead
and
Russell
1927
a
in
the
Principia
Mathematica
Expressions
which
denote
elements
of
type
α
are
called
well-formed
formulas
wffs
of
type
α
Thus
statements
of
type
theory
are
wffs
of
type
o
If
bA
alpha
is
a
wff
of
type
α
in
which
bu

the

such
that
forall
bv
beta
bu
alpha
beta
bv
beta
bA
alpha
is
denoted
by
lambda
bv
beta
bA
alpha
Thus
lambda
bv
beta
is
a
variable-binder
like
forall
bv
beta
or
exists
bv
beta
but
with
a
quite
different
meaning
of
course
λ
is
known
as
an
abstraction
operator
lambda
bv
beta
bA
alpha
denotes
the
function
whose
value
on
any
argument
bv
beta
is
bA
alpha
where
bv
beta
may
occur
free
in
bA
alpha
For
example
lambda
n
sigma
4
cdot
n
sigma
3
denotes
the
function
whose
value
on
any
natural
number
n
is
4
cdot
n
3
Hence
when
we
apply
this
function
to
the
number

we
obtain

a

for
the
result

substituting
bB
for

bB
bv
bA
as
a

for
the

Of
course
when

a

lambda

beta
bA

denotes
the
set
of
all

of

of
which
bA

true
this
set
may
also
be
denoted
by
bv

For
example
lambda
x
x
y
denotes
the
set
of

such
that
x
is
less

as
well
as
that
property
which
a

x
has
if
it
is
less

notation

Formulas
as
certain
terms
Before
we
state
the
definition
of
a
formula
a
word
of
caution
is
in
order
The
reader
may
be
accustomed
to
thinking
of
a
formula
as
an
expression
which
plays
the
role
of
an
assertion
in
a
formal
language
and
of
a
term
as
an
expression
which
designates
an
object
Church’s
terminology
is
somewhat
different
and
provides
a
uniform
way
of
discussing
expressions
of
many
different
types
What
we
call
well-formed
formula
of
type
α
text{wff
alpha
below
would
in
more
standard
terminology
be
called
term
of
type
α
and
then
only
certain
terms
namely
those
with
type
o
would
be
called
formulas
Anyhow
in
this
entry
we
have
decided
to
stay
with
Church’s
original
terminology
Another
remark
concerns
the
use
of
some
specific
mathematical
notation
In
what
follows
the
entry
distinguishes
between
the
symbols
imath
iota
alpha
o
alpha
and
atoi
The
first
is
the
symbol
used
for
the
type
of
individuals
the
second
is
the
symbol
used
for
a
logical
constant
see
Section

below
the

Definitions
Type
symbols
are
defined
inductively
as
follows
imath
is
a
type
symbol
denoting
the
type
of
individuals
There
may
also
be
additional
primitive
type
symbols
which
are
used
in
formalizing
disciplines
where
it
is
natural
to
have
several
sorts
of
individuals
o
is
a
type
symbol
denoting
the
type
of
truth
values
If
α
and
β
are
type
symbols
then
alpha
beta
is
a
type
symbol
denoting
the
type
of
functions
from
elements
of
type
β
to
elements
of
type
α
The
primitive
symbols
are
the
following
Improper

for

lor

and
Pi

alpha
is
used
in
defining
the

as
a

or

operator
as
discussed

below
In
addition
there
may
be
other
constants
of
various
types
which
will
be
called
nonlogical
constants
or
parameters
Each
choice
of
parameters
determines
a
particular
formulation
of
the
system
of
type
theory
Parameters
are
typically
used
as
names
for
particular
entities
in
the
discipline
being
formalized
A
formula
is
a
finite
sequence
of
primitive
symbols
Certain
formulas
are
called
well-formed
formulas
wffs
We
write
textrm{wff
alpha
as
an
abbreviation
for
wff
of
type
α
and
define
this
concept
inductively
as
follows
A
primitive
variable
or
constant
of
type
α
is
a
wff
alpha
If
bA
alpha
beta
and
bB
beta
are
wffs
of
the
indicated
types
then
bA
alpha
beta
bB
beta
is
a
wff
alpha
If
bx
beta
is
a
variable
of
type
β
and
bA
alpha
is
a
wff
then
lambda
bx
beta
bA
alpha
is
a
wff
alpha
beta
Note
for
example
that
by
a
nsim
o
o
is
a
wff
o
o
so
by
b
if
bA
o
is
a
wff
o
then
nsim
o
o
bA
o
is
a
wff
o
Usually
the
latter
wff
will
simply
be
written
as
nsim
bA
It
is
often
convenient
to
avoid
parentheses
brackets
and
type
symbols
and
use
conventions
for
omitting
them
For
formulas
we
use
the
convention
of
association
to
the
right
and
we
may
write
lor
oo)o
bA
o
bB
o
instead
of
lor
oo)o
bA
o
bB
o
For
types
the
corresponding
convention
is
analogous

Examples
We
now
provide
a
few
examples
to
illustrate
how
various
assertions
and
concepts
can
be
expressed
in
Church’s
type
theory
Example
1
To
express
the
assertion
that
Napoleon
is
charismatic
we
introduce
constants
const{Charismatic
o
imath
and
const{Napoleon
imath
with
the
types
indicated
by
their
subscripts
and
the
obvious
meanings
and
assert
the
wff
const{Charismatic
o
imath
const{Napoleon
imath
If
we
wish
to
express
the
assertion
that
Napoleon
has
all
the
properties
of
a
great
general
we
might
consider
interpreting
this
to
mean
that
Napoleon
has
all
the
properties
of
some
great
general
but
it
seems
more
appropriate
to
interpret
this
statement
as
meaning
that
Napoleon
has
all
the
properties
which
all
great
generals
have
If
the
constant
const{GreatGeneral
o
imath
is
added
to
the
formal
language
this
can
be
expressed
by
the
wff
forall
p
o
imath
forall
g
imath
const{GreatGeneral
o
imath}g
imath
supset
p
o
imath}g
imath
supset
p
o
imath
const{Napoleon
imath
As
an
example
of
such
a
property
we
note
that
the
sentence
Napoleon’s
soldiers
admire
him
can
be
expressed
in
a
similar
way
by
the
wff
forall
x
imath
const{Soldier
o
imath}x
imath
land
const{CommanderOf
imath\imath}x
imath
const{Napoleon
imath
supset
const{Admires
o
imath\imath}x
imath
const{Napoleon
imath
By
λ-conversion
this
is
equivalent
to
lambda
n
imath
forall
x
imath
const{Soldier
o
imath}x
imath
land
const{CommanderOf
imath\imath}x
imath
n
imath
supset
const{Admires
o
imath\imath}x
imath}n
imath
const{Napoleon
imath
This
statement
asserts
that
one
of
the
properties
which
Napoleon
has
is
that
of
being
admired
by
his
soldiers
The
property
itself
is
expressed
by
the
wff
lambda
n
imath
forall
x
imath
const{Soldier
o
imath}x
imath

const{CommanderOf

Example
2
We
illustrate
some
potential
applications
of
type
theory
with
the
following
fable
A
rich
and
somewhat
eccentric
lady
named
Sheila
has
an
ostrich
and
a
cheetah
as
pets
and
she
wishes
to
take
them
from
her
hotel
to
her
remote
and
almost
inaccessible
farm
Various
portions
of
the
trip
may
involve
using
elevators
boxcars
airplanes
trucks
very
small
boats
donkey
carts
suspension
bridges
etc
and
she
and
the
pets
will
not
always
be
together
She
knows
that
she
must
not
permit
the
ostrich
and
the
cheetah
to
be
together
when
she
is
not
with
them
We
consider
how
certain
aspects
of
this
problem
can
be
formalized
so
that
Sheila
can
use
an
automated
reasoning
system
to
help
analyze
the
possibilities
There
will
be
a
set
Moments
of
instants
or
intervals
of
time
during
the
trip
She
will
start
the
trip
at
the
location
const{Hotel
and
moment
const{Start
and
end
it
at
the
location
const{Farm
and
moment
const{Finish
Moments
will
have
type
tau
and
locations
will
have
type
varrho
A
state
will
have
type
sigma
and
will
specify
the
location
of
Sheila
the
ostrich
and
the
cheetah
at
a
given
moment
A
plan
will
specify
where
the
entities
will
be
at
each
moment
according
to
this
plan
It
will
be
a
function
from
moments
to
states
and
will
have
type
sigma
tau
The
exact
representation
of
states
need
not
concern
us
but
there
will
be
functions
from
states
to
locations
called
const{LocationOfSheila
const{LocationOfOstrich
and
const{LocationOfCheetah
which
provide
the
indicated
information
Thus
const{LocationOfSheila
varrho
sigma
p
sigma
tau}t
tau
will
be
the
location
of
Sheila
according
to
plan
p
sigma
tau
at
moment
t
tau
The
set
const{Proposals
o
sigma
tau
is
the
set
of
plans
Sheila
is
considering
We
define
a
plan
p
to
be
acceptable
if
according
to
that
plan
the
group
starts
at
the
hotel
finishes
at
the
farm
and
whenever
the
ostrich
and
the
cheetah
are
together
Sheila
is
there
too
Formally
we
define
const{Acceptable
o
sigma
tau
as

We
now
provide
a
mathematical
example
Mathematical
ideas
can
be
expressed
in
type
theory
without
introducing
any
new
constants
An
iterate
of
a
function
f
from
a
set
to
itself
is
a
function
which
applies
f
one
or
more
times
For
example
if
g(x
f(f(f(x
then
g
is
an
iterate
of
f
text{ITERATE
o
imath\imath
imath\imath
f
imath\imath}g
imath\imath
means
that
g
imath\imath
is
an
iterate
of
f
imath\imath
text{ITERATE
o
imath\imath
imath\imath
is
defined
inductively
as
lambda
f
imath\imath
lambda
g

imath\imath

j
imath\imath}x
imath
right
right
right
supset
p
o
imath\imath
g

Thus
g
is
an
iterate
of
f
if
g
is
in
every
set
p
of
functions
which
contains
f
and
which
contains
the
function
lambda
x
imath}f
imath\imath
j
imath\imath}x
imath
i.e
f
composed
with
j
whenever
it
contains
j
A
fixed
point
of
f
is
an
element
y
such
that
f(y
y
It
can
be
proved
that
if
some
iterate
of
a
function
f
has
a
unique
fixed
point
then
f
itself
has
a
fixed
point

theorem

See
Andrews
et
al
1996
for
a
discussion
of
how
this
theorem
which
is
called
THM
15
B
can
be
proved
automatically
Example

An
example
from
philosophy
is
Gödel’s
variant
of
the
ontological
argument
for
the
existence
of
God
This
example
illustrates
two
interesting
aspects
Church’s
type
theory
can
be
employed
as
a
meta-logic
to
concisely
embed
expressive
other
logics
such
as
the
higher-order
modal
logic
assumed
by
Gödel
By
exploiting
the
possible
world
semantics
of
this
target
logic
its
syntactic
elements
are
defined
in
such
a
way
that
the
infrastructure
of
the
meta-logic
are
reused
as
much
as
possible
In
this
technique
called
shallow
semantical
embedding
the
modal
operator
Box
for
example
is
simply
identified
with
taken
as
syntactic
sugar
for
the
λ-formula
lambda
varphi
o
imath
lambda
w
imath
forall
v
imath
R
o
imath\imath
w
imath
v
imath
supset
varphi
o
imath
v
imath
where
R
o
imath\imath
denotes
the
accessibility
relation
associated
with
Box
and
type
imath
is
identified
with
possible
worlds
Moreover
since
forall
x
alpha
bA
o
alpha
x
alpha
is
shorthand
in
Church’s
type
theory
for
Pi
o
o
alpha
lambda
x
alpha
bA
o
alpha
x
alpha
the
modal
formula
Box
forall
x
bP
x
is
represented
as
Box
Pi
lambda
x
alpha
lambda
w
imath
bP
o
imath\alpha
x
alpha
w
imath
where
Pi
stands
for
the
λ-term
lambda
Phi
o
imath\alpha
lambda
w
imath
forall
x
alpha
Phi
o
imath\alpha
x
alpha
w
imath
and
the
Box
gets
resolved
as
described
above
The
above
choice
of
Pi
realizes
a
possibilist
notion
of
quantification
By
introducing
a
binary
existence
predicate
in
the
metalogic
and
by
utilizing
this
predicate
as
an
additional
guard
in
the
definition
of
Pi
an
actualist
notion
of
quantification
can
be
obtained
Expressing
that
an
embedded
modal
formula
varphi
o
imath
is
globally
valid
is
captured
by
the
formula
forall
x
imath
varphi
o
imath
x
imath
Local
validity
and
also
actuality
can
be
modeled
as
varphi
o
imath
n
imath
where
n
imath
is
a
nominal
constant
symbol
in
the
meta-logic
denoting
a
particular
possible
world
The
above
technique
can
be
exploited
for
a
natural
encoding
and
automated
assessment
of
Gödel’s
ontological
argument
in
higher-order
modal
logic
which
unfolds
into
formulas
in
Church’s
type
theory
such
that
higher-order
theorem
provers
can
be
applied

Suppose
we
omit
the
use
of
type
symbols
in
the
definitions
of
wffs
Then
we
can
write
the
formula
lambda
x\nsim[xx
which
we
shall
call
textrm{R
It
can
be
regarded
as
denoting
the
set
of
all
sets
x
such
that
x
is
not
in
x
We
may
then
consider
the
formula
textrm{R
R
which
expresses
the
assertion
that
textrm{R
is
in
itself
We
can
clearly
prove
textrm{R
R
equiv
lambda
x\nsim
xx
textrm{R
so
by
λ-conversion
we
can
derive
textrm{R
R
equiv
nsim
textrm{R
R
which
is
a
contradiction
This
is
Russell’s
paradox
Russell’s
discovery
of
this
paradox

played
a
crucial
role
in
the
development
of
type
theory
Of
course
when
type
symbols
are
present
textrm{R
is
not
well-formed
and
the

cannot

We
have
thus
derived
a
well
known
law
of
quantification
theory
We
illustrate
one
possible
interpretation
of
the
line

wff
which
is
closely
related
to
Axiom
E

by
considering
a
situation
in
which
a
rancher
puts
some
horses
in
a
corral
and
leaves
for
the
night
Later
he
cannot
remember
whether
he
closed
the
gate
to
the
corral
While
reflecting
on
the
situation
he
comes
to
a
conclusion
which
can
be
expressed
on
line
7
if
we
take
the
horses
to
be
the
elements
of
type
imath
interpret
p
o
to
mean
the
gate
was
closed
and
interpret
r
o
imath
so
that
r
o
imath}x
imath
asserts
x
imath
left
the
corral
With
this
interpretation
line
7
says
If
it
is
true
of
every
horse
that
the
gate
was
closed
or
that
the
horse
left
the
corral
then
the
gate
was
closed
or
every
horse
left
the
corral

the
axioms
listed

we

the

obtain

that

we
can

the

that

such

When

it
is
convenient
to

the
notation

to
represent
the

Russell
showed
in
Whitehead
Russell
1927
b
how
to
provide
contextual
definitions
for
such
notations
in
his
formulation
of
type
theory
In
Church’s
type
theory
atoi\bx
alpha
bA
o
is
defined
as
iota
alpha
o
alpha
lambda
bx
alpha
bA
o
Thus
atoi
behaves
like
a
variable-binding
operator
but
it
is
defined
in
terms
of
λ
with
the
aid
of
the
logical
constant
iota
alpha
o
alpha
Thus
λ
is
still
the
only
variable-binding
operator
that
is
needed
Since
bA
o
describes
bx
alpha
iota
alpha
o
alpha
is
called
a
description
operator
Associated
with
this
notation
is
the
following
Axiom
of
Descriptions
exists
1
x
alpha
p
o
alpha}x
alpha
supset
p
o
alpha
iota
alpha
o
alpha
p
o
alpha
tag

alpha
This
says
that
when
the
set
p
o
alpha
has
a
unique
member
then
iota
alpha
o
alpha
p
o
alpha
is
in
p
o
alpha
and
therefore
is
that
unique
member
Thus
this
axiom
asserts
that
iota
alpha
o
alpha
maps
one-element
sets
to
their
unique
members
If
from
certain
hypotheses
one
can
prove
exists
1
bx
alpha
bA
o
then
by
using
Axiom
8
alpha
one
can
derive
lambda
bx
alpha
bA
o
iota
alpha
o
alpha
lambda
bx
alpha
bA
o
which
can
also
be
written
as
lambda
bx
alpha
bA
o
atoi\bx
alpha
bA
o
We
illustrate
the
usefulness
of
the
description
operator
with
a
small
example
Suppose
we
have
formalized
the
theory
of
real
numbers
and
our
theory
has
constants
1
varrho
and
times
varrho
varrho
varrho
to
represent
the
number
1
and
the
multiplication
function
respectively
Here
varrho
is
the
type
of
real
numbers
To
represent
the
multiplicative
inverse
function
we
can
define
the
wff
textrm{INV
varrho
varrho
as
lambda
z
varrho
atoi
x
varrho
times
varrho
varrho
varrho}z
varrho}x
varrho
1
varrho
Of
course
in
traditional
mathematical
notation
we
would
not
write
the
type
symbols
and
we
would
write
times
varrho
varrho
varrho}z
varrho}x
varrho
as
z
times
x
and
write
textrm{INV
varrho
varrho}z
as
z
1
Thus
z
1
is
defined
to
be
that
x
such
that
z
times
x
1
When
Z
is
provably
not
0
we
will
be
able
to
prove
exists
1
x
varrho
times
varrho
varrho
varrho
textrm{Z

varrho
and
Z
times

but
if
we
cannot
establish
that
Z
is
not

nothing
significant
about
Z

will
be
provable

Axiom
of
Choice
The
Axiom
of
Choice
can
be
expressed
as

in
Church’s
type
theory
exists

alpha
supset
p

alpha
says
that
the
choice

from
every
nonempty
set
p
o
alpha
an
element
designated
as
iota
alpha
o
alpha
p
o
alpha
of
that
set
When
this
form
of
the
Axiom
of
Choice
is
included
in
the
list
of
axioms
iota
alpha
o
alpha
is
called
a
selection
operator
instead
of
a
description
operator
and
atoi\bx
alpha
bA
o
means
an
bx
alpha
such
that
bA
o
when
there
is
some
such
element
bx
alpha
These
selection
operators
have
the
same
meaning
as
Hilbert’s
epsilon
operator
Hilbert
1928
However
we
here
provide
one
such
operator
for
each
type
α
It
is
natural
to
call
atoi
a
definite
description
operator
in
contexts
where
atoi\bx
alpha
bA
o
means
the
bx
alpha
such
that
bA
o
and
to
call
it
an
indefinite
description
operator
in
contexts
where
atoi\bx
alpha
bA
o
means
an
bx
alpha
such
that
bA
o
Clearly
the
Axiom
of
Choice
implies
the
Axiom
of
Descriptions
but
sometimes
formulations
of
type
theory
are
used
which
include
the
Axiom
of
Descriptions
but
not
the
Axiom
of
Choice
Another
formulation
of
the
Axiom
of
Choice
simply
asserts
the
existence
of
a
choice
function
without
explicitly
naming
it
exists

Normally
when
one
assumes
the
Axiom
of

in
type
theory
one
assumes
it
as
an
axiom
schema
and
asserts
AC

for
each
type

A
similar
remark
applies
to
the
axioms
for

and
description
However
modern

systems
for
Church’s

which
are
e.g
based
on

do
in
fact
avoid
the
addition
of

for
reasons
as
further
explained
in
Sections

and

They
work
with
more
constrained

we
need

some
terminology
cQ

an
alternative
formulation
of

the

the

the
reflexive

the
minimal

such
that

Given
a
set
S
of
types
none
of
which
is
propositional
there
is
a

in
which

The
existence
of
a

for
higher
types
thus
entails
the
existence
of
choice
functions
for
lower
types
the
opposite
is
generally
not
the
case
though
Büchi
1953
has
shown
that
while
the
schemas
expressing
the
Axiom
of
Choice
and

can
be
derived
from
each
other

Axioms
of
Infinity
One
can
define
the
natural
numbers
and
therefore
other
basic
mathematical
structures
such
as
the
real
and
complex
numbers
in
type
theory
but
to
prove
that
they
have
the
required
properties
such
as
Peano’s
Postulates
one
needs
an
Axiom
of

There
are
many
viable
possibilities
for
such

as
those
discussed

noted
that
in
the
context
of
higher-order
logic
one
can
define
propositional
connectives
in
terms
of
logical
equivalence
and
quantifiers
Quine

showed
how
both
quantifiers

connectives
can
be
defined
in
terms
of
equality
and
the
abstraction
operator
λ
in
the
context
of
Church’s
type
theory
Henkin
1963
rediscovered
these
definitions
and
developed
a
formulation
of
Church’s
type
theory
based
on
equality
in
which
he
restricted
attention
to
propositional
types
Andrews

simplified
the

for
this

cQ

To
see
that
this

Pi

s

asserts
that
s

is
the
set
of
all

type
α
so
s

alpha
contains
all
elements
of

can
be
seen
that

can
also
be
written
as
forall
x

x

which
asserts
that
everything

This
is

so
F

are
precisely
the
wffs
which
are
valid
in
all
interpretations

the
natural
interpretations
of
type
theory
are
standard
models
which
are
defined
below
However
it
is
a
consequence
of
Gödel’s
Incompleteness
Theorem
Gödel
1931
that
axioms
1
9
do
not
suffice
to
derive
all
wffs
which
are
valid
in
all
standard
models
and
there
is
no
consistent
recursively
axiomatized
extension
of
these
axioms
which
suffices
for
this
purpose
Nevertheless
experience
shows
that
these
axioms
are
sufficient
for
most
purposes
and
Leon
Henkin
considered
the
problem
of
clarifying
in
what
sense
they
are
complete
The
definitions
and
theorem
below
constitute
Henkin’s
1950
solution
to
this
problem
which
is
often
referred
to
as
general
semantics
or
Henkin
semantics
A
frame
is
a
collection
cD
alpha
alpha
of
nonempty
domains
sets
cD
alpha
one
for
each
type
symbol
α
such
that
cD
o
sfT
sfF
where
sfT
represents
truth
and
sfF
represents
falsehood
and
cD
alpha
beta
is
some
collection
of
functions
mapping
cD
beta
into
cD
alpha
The
members
of
cD
imath
are
called
individuals
An
interpretation
langle
cD
alpha
alpha
frI\rangle
consists
of
a
frame
and
a
function
frI
which
maps
each
constant
C
of
type
α
to
an
appropriate
element
of
cD
alpha
which
is
called
the
denotation
of
C
The
logical
constants
are
given
their
standard
denotations
An
assignment
of
values
in
the
frame
cD
alpha
alpha
to
variables
is
a
function
phi
such
that
phi
bx
alpha
in
cD
alpha
for
each
variable
bx
alpha
Notation
The
assignment
phi[a/x
maps
variable
x
to
value
a
and
it
is
identical
with
phi
for
all
other
variable
symbols
different
from
x
An
interpretation
cM
langle
cD
alpha
alpha
frI\rangle
is
a
general
model
aka
Henkin
model
iff
there
is
a
binary
function

such
that

in

for
each

the

that
assignment
such
that

and

If
an
interpretation
cM
is
a
general
model
the
function
cV
is
uniquely
determined
cV
phi
bA
alpha
is
called
the
value
of
bA
alpha
in
cM
with
respect
to
phi
One
can
easily
show
that
the
following
statements
hold
in
all
general
models
cM
for
all
assignments
phi
and
all
wffs
bA
and

iff
there
exists
an
a

such
that
cV

The
semantics
of
general
models
is
thus
as
expected
However
there
is
a
subtlety
to
note
regarding
the
following
condition
for
arbitrary
types
α
equality
cV
phi
bA
alpha
bB
alpha
sfT
iff
cV
phi
bA
alpha
cV
phi
bB
alpha
When
the
definitions
of
Section
1
2
1
are
employed
where
equality
has
been
defined
in
terms
of
Leibniz
principle
then
this
statement
is
not
implied
for
all
types
α
It
only
holds
if
we
additionally
require
that
the
domains
cD
o
alpha
contain
all
the
unit
sets
of
objects
of
type
α
or
alternatively
that
the
domains
cD
o
alpha\alpha
contain
the
respective
identity
relations
on
objects
of
type
α
which
entails
the
former
The
need
for
this
additional
requirement
which
is
not
included
in
the
original
work
of
Henkin
1950
has
been
demonstrated
in
Andrews
1972
a
When
instead
the
alternative
definitions
of
Section
1
4
are
employed
then
this
requirement
is
obviously
met
due
to
the
presence
of
the
logical
constants
sfQ
o
alpha
alpha
in
the
signature
which
by
definition
denote
the
respective
identity
relations
on
the
objects
of
type
α
and
therefore
trivially
ensure
their
existence
in
each
general
model
cM
It
is
therefore
a
natural
option
to
always
assume
primitive
equality
constants
for
each
type
α
in
a
concrete
choice
of
base
system
for
Church’s
type
theory
just
as
realized
in
Andrews
system

An
interpretation
langle
cD

is
a
standard

iff
for
all
α
and
beta
cD
alpha
beta
is
the
set
of
all
functions
from
cD
beta
into
cD
alpha
Clearly
a
standard
model
is
a
general
model
We
say
that
a
wff
bA
is
valid
in
a
model
cM
iff
cV
phi
bA
sfT
for
every
assignment
phi
into
cM
A
model
for
a
set
cH
of
wffs
is
a
model
in
which
each
wff
of
cH
is
valid
A
wff
bA
is
valid
in
the
general
standard
sense
iff
bA
is
valid
in
every
general
standard
model
Clearly
a
wff
which
is
valid
in
the
general
sense
is
valid
in
the
standard
sense
but
the
converse
of
this
statement
is
false
Completeness
and
Soundness
Theorem
Henkin
1950
A
wff
is
a
theorem
if
and
only
if
it
is
valid
in
the
general
sense
Not
all
frames
belong
to
interpretations
and
not
all
interpretations
are
general
models
In
order
to
be
a
general
model
an
interpretation
must
have
a
frame
satisfying
certain
closure
conditions
which
are
discussed
further
in
Andrews
1972
b
Basically
in
a
general
model
every
wff
must
have
a
value
with
respect
to
each
assignment
A
model
is
said
to
be
finite
iff
its
domain
of
individuals
is
finite
Every
finite
model
for
cQ
0
is
standard
Andrews
2002
Theorem
5404
but
every
set
of
sentences
of
cQ
0
which
has
infinite
models
also
has
nonstandard
models
Andrews
2002
Theorem
5506
An
understanding
of
the
distinction
between
standard
and
nonstandard
models
can
clarify
many
phenomena
For
example
it
can
be
shown
that
there
is
a
model
cM
langle
cD
alpha
alpha
frI\rangle
in
which
cD
imath
is
infinite
and
all
the
domains
cD
alpha
are
countable
Thus
cD
imath
and
cD
o
imath
are
both
countably
infinite
so
there
must
be
a
bijection
h
between
them
However
Cantor’s
Theorem
which
is
provable
in
type
theory
and
therefore
valid
in
all
models
says
that
cD
imath
has
more
subsets
than
members
This
seemingly
paradoxical
situation
is
called
Skolem’s
Paradox
It
can
be
resolved
by
looking
carefully
at
Cantor’s
Theorem
i.e
nsim
exists
g
o
imath\imath
forall
f
o
imath
exists
j
imath
g
o
imath\imath}j
imath
f
o
imath
and
considering
what
it
means
in
a
model
The
theorem
says
that
there
is
no
function
g
in
cD
o
imath\imath
from
cD
imath
into
cD
o
imath
which
has
every
set
f
o
imath
in
cD
o
imath
in
its
range
The
usual
interpretation
of
the
statement
is
that
cD
o
imath
is
bigger
in
cardinality
than
cD
imath
However
what
it
actually
means
in
this
model
is
that
h
cannot
be
in
cD
o
imath\imath
Of
course
cM
must
be
nonstandard
While
the
Axiom
of
Choice
is
presumably
true
in
all
standard
models
there
is
a
nonstandard
model
for
cQ
0
in
which
AC
imath
is
false
Andrews
1972
b
Thus
AC
imath
is
not
provable
in
cQ
0
Thus
far
investigations
of
model
theory
for
Church’s
type
theory
have
been
far
less
extensive
than
for
first-order
logic
Nevertheless
there
has
been
some
work
on
methods
of
constructing
nonstandard
models
of
type
theory
and
models
in
which
various
forms
of
extensionality
fail
models
for
theories
with
arbitrary
possibly
incomplete
sets
of
logical
constants
and
on
developing
general
methods
of
establishing
completeness
of
various
systems
of
axioms
with
respect
to
various
classes
of
models

Lambda-Conversion
The
first
three
rules
of
inference
in
Section
1

1
are
called
rules
of
λ-conversion
If
bD
and
bE
are
wffs
we
write
bD
conv
bE
to
indicate
that
bD
can
be
converted
to
bE
by
applications
of
these
rules
This
is
an
equivalence
relation
between
wffs
A
wff
bD
is
in
β-normal
form
iff
it
has
no
well-formed
parts
of
the
form
lambda
bx
alpha
bB
beta
bA
alpha
Every
wff
is
convertible
to
one
in
β-normal
form
Indeed
every
sequence
of
contractions
applications
of
rule
2
combined
as
necessary
with
alphabetic
changes
of
bound
variables
of
a
wff
is
finite
obviously
if
such
a
sequence
cannot
be
extended
it
terminates
with
a
wff
in
β-normal
form
This
is
called
the
strong
normalization
theorem
By
the
Church-Rosser
Theorem
this
wff
in
β-normal
form
is
unique
modulo
alphabetic
changes
of
bound
variables
For
each
wff
bA
we
denote
by
downarrow
bA
the
first
wff
in
some
enumeration
in
β-normal
form
such
that
bA
conv
downarrow
bA
Then
bD
conv
bE
if
and
only
if
downarrow
bD
downarrow
bE
By
using
the
Axiom
of
Extensionality
one
can
obtain
the
following
derived
rule
of
inference
eta
Contraction
Replace
a
well-formed
part
lambda
by
beta
bB
alpha
beta
by
beta
of
a
wff
by
bB
alpha
beta
provided
by
beta
does
not
occur
free
in
bB
alpha
beta
This
rule
and
its
inverse
which
is
called
eta
Expansion
are
sometimes
used
as
additional
rules
of
λ-conversion
See
Church
1941
Stenlund
1972
Barendregt
1984
and
Barendregt
et
al
2013
for
more
information
about
λ-conversion
It
is
worth
mentioning
again
that
λ-abstraction
replaces
the
need
for
comprehension
axioms
in
Church’s
type
theory

Higher-Order
Unification
The
challenges
in
higher-order
unification
are
outlined
very
briefly
More
details
on
the
topic
are
given
in
Dowek
2001
its
utilization
in
higher-order
theorem
provers
is
also
discussed
in
Benzmüller
Miller
2014
Definition
A
higher-order
unifier
for
a
pair
langle
bA
bB\rangle
of
wffs
is
a
substitution
theta
for
free
occurrences
of
variables
such
that
theta
bA
and
theta
bB
have
the
same
β-normal
form
A
higher-order
unifier
for
a
set
of
pairs
of
wffs
is
a
unifier
for
each
of
the
pairs
in
the
set
Higher-order
unification
differs
from
first-order
unification
Baader
Snyder
2001
in
a
number
of
important
respects
In
particular
1
Even
when
a
unifier
for
a
pair
of
wffs
exists
there
may
be
no
most
general
unifier
Gould

Higher-order
unification
is
undecidable
Huet
1973
b
even
in
the
second-order
case
Goldfarb
1981
However
an
algorithm
has
been
devised
Huet
1975
Jensen
Pietrzykowski
1976
called
pre-unification
which
will
find
a
unifier
for
a
set
of
pairs
of
wffs
if
one
exists
The
pre-unifiers
computed
by
Huet’s
procedure
are
substitutions
that
can
reduce
the
original
unification
problem
to
one
involving
only
so
called
flex-flex
unification
pairs
Flex-flex
pairs
have
variable
head
symbols
in
both
terms
to
be
unified
and
they
are
known
to
always
have
a
solution
The
concrete
computation
of
these
solutions
can
thus
be
postponed
or
omitted
Pre-unification
is
utilized
in
all
the
resolution
based
theorem
provers
mentioned
in
Section
4
Pattern
unification
refers
a
small
subset
of
unification
problems
first
studied
by
Miller
1991
whose
identification
has
been
important
for
the
construction
of
practical
systems
In
a
pattern
unification
problem
every
occurrence
of
an
existentially
quantified
variable
is
applied
to
a
list
of
arguments
that
are
all
distinct
variables
bound
by
either
a
λ-binder
or
a
universal
quantifier
in
the
scope
of
the
existential
quantifier
Thus
existentially
quantified
variables
cannot
be
applied
to
general
terms
but
a
very
restricted
set
of
bound
variables
Pattern
unification
like
first-order
unification
is
decidable
and
most
general
unifiers
exist
for
solvable
problems
This
is
why
pattern
unification
is
preferably
employed
when
applicable
in
some
state-of-the-art
theorem
provers
for
Church’s
type
theory

A
Unifying
Principle
The
Unifying
Principle
was
introduced
in
Smullyan
1963
see
also
Smullyan
1995
as
a
tool
for
deriving
a
number
of
basic
metatheorems
about
first-order
logic
in
a
uniform
way
The
principle
was
extended
to
elementary
type
theory
by
Andrews
1971
and
to
extensional
type
theory
that
is
Henkin’s
general
semantics
without
description
or
choice
by
Benzmüller
Brown
and
Kohlhase

We
outline
these
extensions
in

Elementary

The

was
extended
to
elementary

the
system

of
Section

in
Andrews
1971
by
applying
ideas
in
Takahashi
1967
This
Unifying
Principle
for
cT
has
been
used
to
establish
cut-elimination
for
cT
in
Andrews
1971
and
completeness

for
various
systems
of
type

in
Huet

We
first
give
a

that

Unifying

for

If
Gamma
is
an

and
Gamma

then
cS

Here
is
a
typical
application
of
the
Unifying

Suppose
there
is
a

which
can
be
used
to
refute

Extensional
Type
Theory
Extensions
of
the
above
Unifying
principle
towards
Church’s
type
theory
with
general
semantics
were
studied
since
the
mid
nineties
A
primary
motivation
was
to
support
refutational
completeness
investigations
for
the
proof
calculi
underlying
the
emerging
higher-order
automated
theorem
provers
see
Section
4
below
The
initial
interest
was
on
a
fragment
of
Church’s
type
theory
called
extensional
type
theory
that
includes
the
extensionality
axioms
but
excludes
iota
alpha
o
alpha
and
the
axioms
for
it
description
and
choice
were
largely
neglected
in
the
automated
theorem
provers
at
the
time
Analogous
to
before
a
distinction
has
been
made
between
extensional
type
theory
with
defined
equality
as
in
Section
1
2
1
where
equality
is
defined
via
Leibniz
principle
and
extensional
type
theory
with
primitive
equality
e.g
system
cQ
0
as
in
Section
1
4
or
alternatively
a
system
based
on
logical
constants
nsim
o
o
lor
o
o
o
and
the
Pi
o
o
alpha
s
as
in
Section
1
2

but
with
additional
primitive
logical
constants
o
alpha\alpha
added
A
first
attempt
towards
a
Unifying
Principle
for
extensional
type
theory
with
primitive
equality
is
presented
in
Kohlhase
1993
The
conditions
given
there
which
are
still
incomplete

were
subsequently
modified
and
complemented
as
follows
To
obtain
a
Unifying
Principle
for
extensional
type
theory
with
defined
equality
Benzmüller
Kohlhase
1997
added
the
following
conditions
for
boolean
extensionality
functional
extensionality
and
saturation
to
the
above
conditions

for
cT
their
presentation
has
been
adapted
here
for
technical
reasons
they
also
employ
a
slightly
stronger
variant
for
condition

based
on
β-conversion
rather
than
β-normalization

The
saturation
condition
10
was
required
to
properly
establish
the
principle
However
since
this
condition
is
related
to
the
proof
theoretic
notion
of
cut-elimination
it
limits
the
utility
of
the
principle
in
completeness
proofs
for
machine-oriented
calculi
The
principle
was
nevertheless
used
in
Benzmüller
Kohlhase
1998
a
and
Benzmüller
1999
a,b
to
obtain
a
completeness
proof
for
a
system
of
extensional
higher-order
resolution
The
principle
was
also
applied
in
Kohlhase
1998
to
study
completeness
for
a
related
extensional
higher-order
tableau
calculus

in
which
the
extensionality
rules
for
Leibniz
equality
were
adapted
from
Benzmüller
Kohlhase
1998
a
respectively
Benzmüller
1997
Different
options
for
achieving
a
Unifying
Principle
for
extensional
type
theory
with
primitive
equality
are
presented
in
Benzmüller
1999
a
in
this
work
primitive
logical
constants
o
alpha\alpha
were
used
in
addition
to
nsim
o
o
lor
o
o
o
and
the
Pi
o
o
alpha
s
such
a
redundant
choice
of
logical
constants
is
not
rare
in
higher-order
theorem
provers
One
option
is
to
introduce
a
reflexivity
and
substitutivity
condition
An
alternative
is
to
combine
a
reflexivity
condition
with
a
condition
connecting
primitive
with
defined
equality
so
that
the
substitutivity
condition
follows
Note
that
introducing
a
defined
notion
of
equality
based
on
the
Leibniz
principle
is
of
course
still
possible
in
this
context
defined
equality
is
denoted
in
the
remainder
of
this
section
by

it

LEO

In
Benzmüller
et

2004
the
principle
is
presented
in
a
very
general
way
which
allows
for
various
possibilities
concerning
the
treatment
of
extensionality
and
equality
in
the
range
between
elementary

The

is
applied
to

thesis
a

for
replacing
the
undesirable

presented
in

further
studies
the
relation
between

The
two
weaker
conditions
termed

and
decomposition
are
easier
to
demonstrate
than
saturation
in
completeness

for
machine-oriented

The
modified

is
applied
in
Benzmüller
et

2009
to
show
completeness
for
a
sequent

for
extensional

with

A
further
extended
Unifying

to
prove
the

of
a

A
closely

has
also
been
presented
and
studied
in

In

it

and

can
be
used
to
justify

Moreover
the
notions
of
cut-simulation
and
cut-strong
axioms
are
introduced
in
this
work
and
the
need
for
omitting
defined
equality
and
for
eliminating
cut-strong
axioms
such
as
extensionality
description
choice
and
induction
in
machine-oriented
calculi
e.g
by
replacing
them
with
more
constrained
goal-directed
rules
in
order
to
reduce
cut-simulation
effects
are
discussed
as
a
major
challenge
for
higher-order
automated
theorem
proving
In
other
words
including
cut-strong
axioms
in
a
machine-oriented
proof
calculus
for
Church’s
type
theory
is
essentially
as
bad
as
including
a
cut
rule
since
the
cut
rule
can
be
mimicked
by
them

Expansion
Proofs
An
expansion
proof
is
a
generalization
of
the
notion
of
a
Herbrand
expansion
of
a
theorem
of
first-order
logic
it
provides
a
very
elegant
concise
and
nonredundant
representation
of
the
relationship
between
the
theorem
and
a
tautology
which
can
be
obtained
from
it
by
appropriate
instantiations
of
quantifiers
and
which
underlies
various
proofs
of
the
theorem
Miller
1987
proved
that
a
wff
bA
is
a
theorem
of
elementary
type
theory
if
and
only
if
bA
has
an
expansion
proof
In
Brown
2004
and
2007
this
concept
is
generalized
to
that
of
an
extensional
expansion
proof
to
obtain
an
analogous
theorem
involving
type
theory
with
extensionality

The
Decision
Problem
Since
type
theory
includes
first-order
logic
it
is
no
surprise
that
most
systems
of
type
theory
are
undecidable
However
one
may
look
for
solvable
special
cases
of
the
decision
problem
For
example
the
system
cQ
0
1
obtained
by
adding
to
cQ
0
the
additional
axiom
forall
x
imath
forall
y
imath
x
imath
y
imath
is
decidable
Although
the
system
cT
of
elementary
type
theory
is
analogous
to
first-order
logic
in
certain
respects
it
is
a
considerably
more
complex
language
and
special
cases
of
the
decision
problem
for
provability
in
cT
seem
rather
intractable
for
the
most
part
Information
about
some
very
special
cases
of
this
decision
problem
may
be
found
in
Andrews
1974
and
we
now
summarize
this
A
wff
of
the
form
exists
bx
1
ldots
exists
bx
n
bA
bB
is
a
theorem
of
cT
iff
there
is
a
substitution
theta
such
that
theta
bA
conv
theta
bB
In
particular
vdash
bA
bB
iff
bA
conv
bB
which
solves
the
decision
problem
for
wffs
of
the
form
bA
bB
Naturally
the
circumstance
that
only
trivial
equality
formulas
are
provable
in
cT
changes
drastically
when
axioms
of
extensionality
are
added
to
cT
vdash
exists
bx
beta
bA
bB
iff
there
is
a
wff
bE
beta
such
that
vdash
lambda
bx
beta
bA
bB
bE
beta
but
the
decision
problem
for
the
class
of
wffs
of
the
form
exists
bx
beta
bA
bB
is
unsolvable
A
wff
of
the
form
forall
bx
1
ldots
forall
bx
n\bC
where
bC
is
quantifier-free
is
provable
in
cT
iff
downarrow
bC
is
tautologous
On
the
other
hand
the
decision
problem
for
wffs
of
the
form
exists
bz\bC
where
bC
is
quantifier-free
is
unsolvable
By
contrast
the
corresponding
decision
problem
in
first-order
logic
with
function
symbols
is
known
to
be
solvable
Maslov
1967
Since
irrelevant
or
vacuous
quantifiers
can
always
be
introduced
this
shows
that
the
only
solvable
classes
of
wffs
of
cT
in
prenex
normal
form
defined
solely
by
the
structure
of
the
prefix
are
those
in
which
no
existential
quantifiers
occur

Machine-Oriented
Proof
Calculi
The
development
respectively
improvement
of
machine-oriented
proof
calculi
for
Church’s
type
theory
has
made
good
progress
in
recent
years
see
e.g
the
references
on
superposition
based
calculi
given
below
The
challenges
are
obviously
much
bigger
than
in
first-order
logic
The
practically
way
more
expressive
nature
of
the
term-language
of
Church’s
type
theory
causes
a
larger
bushier
and
more
difficult
to
traverse
proof
search
space
than
in
first-order
logic
Moreover
remember
that
unification
which
constitutes
a
very
important
control
and
filter
mechanism
in
first-order
theorem
proving
is
undecidable
in
general
in
type
theory
see
Section
3
2
On
the
positive
side
however
there
is
a
chance
to
find
significantly
shorter
proofs
than
in
first-order
logic
This
is
well
illustrated
with
a
small
concrete
example
in
Boolos
1987
for
which
a
fully
automated
proof
seems
now
in
reach
Benzmüller
et
al
2023
Clearly
further
progress
is
needed
to
further
leverage
the
practical
relevance
of
existing
calculi
for
Church’s
type
theory
and
their
implementations
see
Section
4
3
The
challenges
include
an
appropriate
handling
of
the
impredicative
nature
of
Church’s
type
theory
some
form
of
blind
guessing
cannot
generally
be
avoided
in
a
complete
proof
procedure
but
must
be
intelligently
guided
the
elimination/reduction
of
cut-simulation
effects
see
Section
3
4
caused
by
defined
equality
or
cut-strong
axioms
e.g
extensionality
description
choice
induction
in
the
search
space
the
general
undecidability
of
unification
rendering
it
a
rather
problematic
filter
mechanism
for
controlling
proof
search
the
invention
of
suitable
heuristics
for
traversing
the
search
space
the
provision
of
suitable
term-orderings
and
their
effective
exploitation
in
term
rewriting
procedures
and
efficient
data
structures
in
combination
with
strong
technical
support
for
essential
operations
such
λ-conversion
substitution
and
rewriting
It
is
planned
that
future
editions
of
this
article
further
elaborate
on
machine-oriented
proof
calculi
for
Church’s
type
theory

the
time
being

Most
of
the

focused
at
least
initially
on
interactive
proof
However
the
TPS
project
in
particular
had
been
working
since
the
mid
1980
s
on
the
integration
of
ND-style
interactive
proof
and
automated
theorem
proving
using
the
mating
method
and
had
investigated
proof
transformation
techniques
between
the
two
This
research
was
further
intensified
in
the
1990
s
when
other
projects
investigated
various
solutions
such
as
proof
planning
and
bridges
to
external
theorem
provers
using
so-called
hammer
tools
The
hammers
developed
at
that
time
were
early
precursors
of
todays
very
successful
hammer

Automated
Theorem
Provers
A
selection
of
theorem
provers
for
Church's
type
theory
is
presented
The
focus
is
on
systems
that
have
successfully
participated
in
TPTP
THF
CASC
competitions
in
the
past
and
the
order
of
presentation
is
motivated
by
their
first-time
CASC
participation
The
latest
editions
of
most
mentioned
systems
can
be
accessed
online
via
the
SystemOnTPTP
infrastructure
Sutcliffe
2017
Nearly
all
mentioned
systems
produce
verifiable
proof
certificates
in
the
TPTP
TSTP
syntax
The
TPS
prover
Andrews
et
al
1996
Andrews
Brown
2006
can
be
used
to
prove
theorems
of
elementary
type
theory
or
extensional
type
theory
automatically
interactively
or
semi-automatically
When
searching
for
a
proof
automatically
TPS
first
searches
for
an
expansion
proof
Miller
1987
or
an
extensional
expansion
proof
Brown
2004
2007
of
the
theorem
Part
of
this
process
involves
searching
for
acceptable
matings
Andrews
1981
Bishop
1999
The
behavior
of
TPS
is
controlled
by
sets
of
flags
also
called
modes
A
simple
scheduling
mechanism
is
employed
in
the
latest
versions
of
TPS
to
sequentially
run
a
about
fifty
modes
for
a
limited
amount
of
time
TPS
was
the
winner
of
the
first
THF
CASC
competition
in
2009
The
LEO-II
prover
Benzmüller
et
al
2015
is
the
successor
of
LEO
Benzmüller
Kohlhase
1998
b
which
was
hardwired
with
the
OMEGA
proof
assistant
LEO
stands
for
Logical
Engine
of
OMEGA
The
provers
are
based
on
the
RUE-resolution
calculi
developed
in
Benzmüller
1999
a,b
LEO
was
the
first
prover
to
implement
calculus
rules
for
extensionality
to
avoid
cut-simulation
effects
LEO-II
inherits
and
adapts
them
and
provides
additional
calculus
rules
for
description
and
choice
The
prover
which
internally
collaborates
with
first-order
provers
preferably
E
and
SAT
solvers
has
pioneered
cooperative
higher-order/first-order
proof
automation
Since
the
prover
is
often
too
weak
to
find
a
refutation
among
the
steadily
growing
set
of
clauses
on
its
own
some
of
the
clauses
in
LEO-II’s
search
space
attain
a
special
status
they
are
first-order
clauses
modulo
the
application
of
an
appropriate
transformation
function
Therefore
LEO-II
progressively
launches
time
limited
calls
with
these
clauses
to
a
first-order
theorem
prover
and
when
the
first-order
prover
reports
a
refutation
LEO-II
also
terminates
Parts
of
these
ideas
were
already
implemented
in
the
predecessor
LEO
Communication
between
LEO-II
and
the
cooperating
first-order
theorem
provers
uses
the
TPTP
language
and
standards
LEO-II
was
the
winner
of
the
second
THF
CASC
competition
in
2010
The
Satallax
prover
Brown
2012
is
based
on
a
complete
ground
tableau
calculus
for
Church’s
type
theory
with
choice
Backes
Brown
2011
An
initial
tableau
branch
is
formed
from
the
assumptions
of
a
conjecture
and
negation
of
its
conclusion
From
that
point
on
Satallax
tries
to
determine
unsatisfiability
or
satisfiability
of
this
branch
Satallax
progressively
generates
higher-order
formulas
and
corresponding
propositional
clauses
Satallax
uses
the
SAT
solver
MiniSat
as
an
engine
to
test
the
current
set
of
propositional
clauses
for
unsatisfiability
If
the
clauses
are
unsatisfiable
the
original
branch
is
unsatisfiable
Satallax
provides
calculus
rules
for
extensionality
description
and
choice
If
there
are
no
quantifiers
at
function
types
the
generation
of
higher-order
formulas
and
corresponding
clauses
may
terminate
In
that
case
if
MiniSat
reports
the
final
set
of
clauses
as
satisfiable
then
the
original
set
of
higher-order
formulas
is
satisfiable
by
a
standard
model
in
which
all
types
are
interpreted
as
finite
sets
Satallax
was
the
winner
of
the
THF
CASC
competition
in
2011
and
from
2013
to
2019
The
Isabelle/HOL
system
Nipkow
Wenzel
Paulson
2002
has
originally
been
designed
as
an
interactive
prover
However
in
order
to
ease
user
interaction
several
automatic
proof
tactics
have
been
added
over
the
years
By
appropriately
scheduling
a
subset
of
these
proof
tactics
some
of
which
are
quite
powerful
Isabelle/HOL
has
since
about
2011
been
turned
also
into
an
automatic
theorem
prover
for
TPTP
THF
and
other
TPTP
syntax
formats
that
can
be
run
from
a
command
shell
like
other
provers
The
most
powerful
proof
tactics
that
are
scheduled
by
Isabelle/HOL
include
the
Sledgehammer
tool
Blanchette
et
al
2013
which
invokes
a
sequence
of
external
first-order
and
higher-order
theorem
provers
the
model
finder
Nitpick
Blanchette
Nipkow
2010
the
equational
reasoner
simp
the
untyped
tableau
prover
blast
the
simplifier
and
classical
reasoners
auto
force
and
fast
and
the
best-first
search
procedure
best
In
contrast
to
all
other
automated
theorem
provers
mentioned
above
the
TPTP
incarnation
of
Isabelle/HOL
does
not
output
proof
certificates
Isabelle/HOL
was
the
winner
of
the
THF
CASC
competition
in
2012
The
agsyHOL
prover
is
based
on
a
generic
lazy
narrowing
proof
search
algorithm
Backtracking
is
employed
and
a
comparably
small
search
state
is
maintained
The
prover
outputs
proof
terms
in
sequent
style
which
can
be
verified
in
the
Agda
system
coqATP
implements
the
non-inductive
part
of
the
calculus
of
constructions
Bertot
Castéran
2004
The
system
outputs
proof
terms
which
are
accepted
as
proofs
after
the
addition
of
a
few
definitions
by
the
Coq
proof
assistant
The
prover
employs
axioms
for
functional
extensionality
choice
and
excluded
middle
Boolean
extensionality
is
not
supported
In
addition
to
axioms
a
small
library
of
basic
lemmas
is
employed
The
Leo-III
prover
implements
a
paramodulation
calculus
for
Church’s
type
theory
Steen
2018
The
system
which
is
a
descendant
of
LEO
and
LEO-II
provides
calculus
rules
for
extensionality
description
and
choice
The
system
has
put
an
emphasis
on
the
implementation
of
an
efficient
set
of
underlying
data
structures
on
simplification
routines
and
on
heuristic
rewriting
In
the
tradition
of
its
predecessors
Leo-III
cooperates
with
first-order
reasoning
tools
using
translations
to
many-sorted
first-order
logic
The
prover
accepts
every
common
TPTP
syntax
dialect
and
is
thus
very
widely
applicable
Recently
the
prover
has
also
been
extended
to
natively
supports
almost
every
normal
higher-order
modal
logic
Steen
et
al
2023
CVC

CVC

and
Verit
Barbosa
et
al
2019
are
SMT-based
automated
provers
with
built-in
support
for
many
theories
including
linear
arithmetic
arrays
bit
vectors
data
types
finite
sets
and
strings
These
provers
have
been
extended
to
support
fragments
of
Church's
type
theory
The
Zipperposition
prover
Bentkamp
et
al
2018
Vukmirović
et
al
2022
focuses
on
the
effective
implementation
of
superposition
calculi
for
Church's
type
theory
It
comes
with
Logtk
a
supporting
library
for
manipulating
terms
formulas
clauses
etc
in
Church's
type
theory
and
supports
relevant
extensions
such
as
datatypes
recursive
functions
and
arithmetic
Zipperposition
was
the
winner
of
the
THF
CASC
competition
in
2020
2021
and
2022
Vampire
Bhayat
Reger
2020
which
has
dominated
the
TPTP
competitions
in
first-order
logic
for
more
than
two
decades
now
also
supports
the
automation
of
Church's
type
theory
using
a
combinator-based
superposition
calculus
Vampire
was
the
winner
of
the
THF
CASC
competition
in
2023
The
theorem
prover
E
Vukmirović
et
al
2023
another
prominent
and
leading
first-order
automated
theorem
prover
has
been
extended
for
Church's
type
theory
using
a
variant
of
the
supperposition
approach
that
is
also
implemented
in
Zipperposition
Lash
Brown
and
Kaliszyk
2022
is
a
theorem
prover
for
Church's
type
theory
created
as
a
fork
of
Satallax
Duper
is
a
superposition-based
theorem
prover
for
dependent
type
theory
deigned
to
prove
theorems
in
the
proof
assistant
Lean
In
recent
years
there
has
thus
been
a
significant
shift
from
first-order
to
higher-order
automated

Counter
Model
Finding
Support
for
finding
finite
models
or
countermodels
for
formulas
of
Church’s
type
theory
was
implemented
already
in
the
tableau-based
prover
HOT
Konrad
1998
Restricted
counter
model
finding
capabilities
are
also
implemented
in
the
provers
Satallax
LEO-II
and
LEO-III
The
most
advanced
finite
model
finding
support
is
currently
realized
in
the
systems
Nitpick
Nunchaku
and
Refute
These
tools
have
been
integrated
with
the
Isabelle
proof
assistant
Nitpick
is
also
available
as
a
standalone
tool
that
accepts
TPTP
THF
syntax
The
systems
are
particularly
valuable
for
exposing
errors
and
misconceptions
in
problem
encodings
and
for
revealing
bugs
in
the
THF
theorem
provers
5
Applications
In
addition
to
its
elegance
Church's
type
theory
also
has
many
practical
advantages
This
aspect
is
emphasised
for
example
in
the
recent
textbook
by
Farmer
2023
which
deals
with
various
relevant
and
important
further
aspects
that
could
not
be
covered
in
this
article
Because
of
its
good
practical
expressiveness
the
range
of
applications
of
Church's
type
theory
is
very
wide
and
only
a
few
examples
can
be
given
below
a
good
source
for
further
information
on
practical
examples
are

Semantics
of
Natural
Language
Church’s
type
theory
plays
an
important
role
in
the
study
of
the
formal
semantics
of
natural
language
Pioneering
work
on
this
was
done
by
Richard
Montague
See
his
papers
English
as
a
formal
language
Universal
grammar
and
The
proper
treatment
of
quantification
in
ordinary
English
which
are
reprinted
in
Montague
1974
A
crucial
component
of
Montague’s
analysis
of
natural
language
is
the
definition
of
a
tensed
intensional
logic
Montague
1974
256
which
is
an
enhancement
of
Church’s
type
theory
Montague
Grammar
had
a
huge
impact
and
has
since
been
developed
in
many
further
directions
not
least
in
Typelogical/Categorical
Grammar
Further
related
work
on
intensional
and
higher-order
modal
logic
is
presented
in
Gallin
1975
and
Muskens

Mathematics
and
Computer
Science
Proof
assistants
based
on
Church’s
Type
Theory
including
Isabelle/HOL
HOL
Light
HOL
4
and
PVS
have
been
successfully
utilized
in
a
broad
range
of
application
in
computer
science
and
mathematics
Applications
in
computer
science
include
the
verification
of
hardware
software
and
security
protocols
A
prominent
example
is
the
L
4
verified
project
in
which
Isabelle/HOL
was
used
to
formally
prove
that
the
seL
4
operating
system
kernel
implements
an
abstract
mathematical
model
specifying
of
what
the
kernel
is
supposed
to
do
Klein
et
al
2018
In
mathematics
proof
assistants
have
been
applied
for
the
development
of
libraries
mathematical
theories
and
the
verification
of
challenge
theorems
An
early
example
is
the
mathematical
library
that
was
developed
since
the
eighties
in
the
TPS
project
A
exemplary
list
of
theorems
that
were
proved
automatically
with
TPS
is
given
in
Andrews
et
al
1996
A
very
prominent
recent
example
is
Hales
Flyspeck
in
which
HOL
Light
was
employed
to
develop
a
formal
proof
for
Kepler’s
conjecture
Hales
et
al
2017
An
example
that
strongly
exploits
automation
support
in
Isabelle/HOL
with
Sledgehammer
and
Nitpick
is
presented
in
Benzmüller
Scott
2019
In
this
work
different
axiom
systems
for
category
theory
were
explored
and
compared
A
solid
overview
of
past
and
ongoing
formalization
projects
can
be
obtained
by
consulting
appropriate
sources
such
as
Isabelle's
Archive
of
Formal
Proofs
the
Journal
of
Formalized
Reasoning
or
the
THF
entries
in
Sutcliffe's
TPTP
problem
library
Relevant
further
information
and
a
discussion
of
implications
and
further
work
can
also
be
found
in
Bentkamp
et
al
2023
b
and
in
Bayer
et
al
2024
Further
improving
proof
automation
within
these
proof
assistants—based
on
proof
hammering
tools
or
on
other
forms
of
prover
integration—is
relevant
for
minimizing
interaction
effort
in
future
applications

Computational
Metaphysics
and
Artificial
Intelligence
Church’s
type
theory
is
a
classical
logic
but
topical
applications
in
philosophy
and
artificial
intelligence
often
require
expressive
non-classical
logics
In
order
to
support
such
applications
with
reasoning
tools
for
Church’s
type
theory
the
shallow
semantical
embedding
technique
see
also
Section

has
been
developed
that
generalizes
and
extends
the
ideas
underlying
the
well
known
standard
translation
of
modal
logics
to
first-order
logic
The
technique
was
applied
for
the
assessment
of
modern
variants
of
the
ontological
argument
with
a
range
of
higher-order
theorem
provers
including
LEO-II
Satallax
Nitpick
and
Isabelle/HOL
In
the
course
of
experiments
LEO-II
detected
an
inconsistency
in
the
premises
of
Gödel’s
argument
while
the
provers
succeeded
in
automatically
proving
Scott’s
emendation
of
it
and
to
confirm
the
consistency
of
the
emended
premises
More
details
on
this
work
are
presented
in
a
related
SEP
entry
on
automated
reasoning
see
Section

on
Logic
and
Philosophy
The
semantical
embedding
approach
has
been
adapted
and
further
extended
for
a
range
of
other
non-classical
logics
and
related
applications
In
philosophy
this
includes
the
encoding
and
formal
assessment
of
ambitious
ethical
and
metaphysical
theories
and
in
artificial
intelligence
this
includes
the
mechanization
of
deontic
logics
and
normative
reasoning
to
control

Metalogical
Studies
Church’s
type
theory
is
also
well
suited
to
support
metalogical
studies
including
the
encoding
of
other
logical
formalisms
and
formalized
soundness
and
completeness
studies

further
pointers

theory
can
be
studied
formally
in
itself

THE
LOGIC
OF
ECONOMICS
Economic
life
is
an
enormously
complicated
hive
of
activity
with
people
buying
selling
bargaining
in
vesting
persuading
and
threatening
The
ultimate
purpose
of
economic
science
and
of
this
text
is
to
understand
this
complex
undertaking
How
do
economists
go
about
their
task
Economists
use
the
scientific
approach
to
understand
economic
life
This
involves
observing
economic
affairs
and
drawing
upon
statistics
and
the
historical
record
For
complex
phenomena
like
the
impacts
of
gelled
deficits
or
the
causes
of
inflation
historical
research
has
provided
a
rich
mine
of
insights
Often
economics
relies
upon
analyses
and
theories
Theoretical
approaches
allow
economists
to
make
broad
generalizations
such
as
those
concerning
the
advantages
of
international
trade
and
specialization
or
the
disadvantages
of
tariffs
and
quotas
In
addition
economists
have
developed
a
specialized
technique
known
as
econometric
which
applies
the
tools
of
statistics
to
economic
problems
Using
econometric
economists
can
sift
through
mountains
of
data
to
extract
simple
relationships.Budding
economists
must
also
be
alert
to
common
fallacies
in
economic
reasoning
Because
economic
relationships
are
often
complex
involving
many
different
variables
it
is
easy
to
become
confused
about
the
exact
reason
behind
events
or
the
impact
of
policies
on
the
economy
The
following
are
some
of
the
common
fallacies
encountered
in
economic
reasoning
The
post
hoc
fallacy
The
first
fallacy
involves
the
inference
of
causality
The
post
hoc
fallacy
occur.s
when
tilt
assume
that
because
on
event
occurred
before
another
event
the
fir.st
event
Taurus
the
second
event
2
An
example
of
this
syndrome
occurred
in
the
Great
Depression
of
the
1930
s
in
the
United
States
Some
people
had
observed
that
periods
of
business
expansion
were
preceded
or
accompanied
by
rising
prices
From
this
they
concluded
that
the
appropriate
remedy
for
depression
was
to
raise
wages
and
prices
This
idea
led
to
a
host
of
legislation
and
regulations
to
prop
lip
wages
and
prices
in
an
inefficient
manner
Did
these
measures
promote
economic
recovery
Almost
surely
not
Indeed
they
probably
slowed
recovery
which
did
not
occur
until
total
spending
Post
hoc
is
shorthand
for
post
hoc
prop
hoc
Translated
from
the
Latin
the
full
expression
means
after
this
therefore
necessarily
because
of
this
began
to
rise
as
the
government
increased
military
spending
ill
preparation
for
World
War
II
Failure
10
hold
other
Hings
constant
A
second
pitfall
is
failure
to
hold
other
things
constant
when
thinking
about
an
issue
For
example
we
might
want
to
know
whether
raising
tax
rates
will
raise
or
lower
tax
revenues
Some
people
have
put
forth
the
seductive
argument
that
we
can
eat
our
fiscal
cake
and
have
it
too
They
argue
that
cutting
tax
rates
will
at
the
same
time
raise
government
revenues
and
lower
the
budget
deficit
They
point
to
the
Kennedy:Johnson
tax
cuts
of
1964
which
lowered
tax
rates
sharply
and
were
followed
by
an
increase
in
government
revenues
in
1965
Hence
they
argue
lower
tax
rates
produce
higher
revenues
What
is
wrong
with
this
reasoning
This
argument
overlooks
the
fact
that
the
economy
grew
from
1964
to
1965
Because
people’s
incomes
grew
during
that
period
government
revenues
also
grew
even
though
tax
rates
were
lower
Careful
studies
indicate
that
revenues
would
have
been
even
higher
in
1965
had
tax
rates
not
been
lowered
in
1964
hence
this
analysis
fails
to
hold
other
things
namely
total
income
constant
Remember
to
hold
other
things
constant
when
you
are
analyzing
the
impact
of
variable
on
the
economic
system
The
fallacy
of
composition
Sometimes
we
assume
that
what
holds
true
for
part
of
a
system
also
holds
true
for
the
whole
In
economics
however,we
often
find
that
the
whole
is
different
from
the
sum
of
the
parts.when
you
assume
that
what
is
true
for
the
part
is
also
true
for
whole
you
are
for
the
whole
committing
the
fallacy
of
composition
Here
are
some
true
statements
that
might
surprise
surprise
you
if
you
ignored
the
fallacy
of
composition
I
If
one
farmer
has
a
bumper
crop
she
has
a
higher
income
if
all
farmers
produce
it
record
crop
farm
incomes
will
fall
2
If
one
person
receives
a
great
d
11
more
money
that
person
will
be
better
off
if
everyone
receives
a
great
deal
more
money
the
society
is
likely
10
be
worse
off
3
If
a
high
tartaric
is
put
on
the
product
of
a
particular
industry
the
producers
in
I
hat
industry
are
likely
to
profit
if
hi
h
tariffs
an
put
on
all
industries
most
producers
and
consumers
will
be
worse
off
I’these
examples
contain
no
tricks
or
magic.Rather
they
are
the
results
of
systems
of
interacting
individuals
Often
the
behavior
of
the
aggregate
looks
very
different
from
the
behavior
of
individual
people
We
mention
these
fallacies
only
briefly
in
this
introduction
Later
as
we
introduce
the
tools
of
economics,we
will
provide
examples
of
how
inattention
to
the
logic
of
economics
can
lead
you
to
false
and
sometimes
costly
errors
When
you
reach
the
end
of
this
book
you
can
look
back
to
see
why
each
of
these
paradoxical
examples
is
true

Motorola
offered
the
XC

a
mask-programmed
gate
array
with
12
gates
and
30
uncommitted
input/output
pins

In
1970
Texas
Instruments
developed
a
mask-programmable
IC
based
on
the
IBM
read-only
associative
memory
or
ROAM
This
device
the
TMS
2000
was
programmed
by
altering
the
metal
layer
during
the
production
of
the
IC
The
TMS
2000
had
up
to
17
inputs
and
18
outputs
with
8
JK
flip-flops
for
memory
TI
coined
the
term
programmable

array
PLA
for
this
device

In
1971
General
Electric
Company
GE
was
developing
a
programmable

had
just
introduced
the
floating-gate
UV
EPROM
so
the
researcher
at
GE
incorporated
that
technology
The
GE
device
was
the
first
erasable
PLD
ever
developed
predating
the
Altera
EPLD
by
over
a
decade
GE
obtained
several
early
patents
on
programmable
logic
devices

In
1973
National
Semiconductor
introduced
a
mask-programmable
PLA
device
DM
7575
with
14
inputs
and
8
outputs
with
no
memory
registers
This
was
more
popular
than
the
TI
part
but
the
cost
of
making
the
metal
mask
limited
its
use
The
device
is
significant
because
it
was
the
basis
for
the
field
programmable
logic
array
produced
by
Signetics
in
1975
the
82
S

Intersil
actually
beat
Signetics
to
market
but
poor
yield
doomed
their

In
1974
GE
entered
into
an
agreement
with
Monolithic
Memories
MMI
to
develop
a
mask-programmable
logic
device
incorporating
the
GE
innovations
The
device
was
named
programmable
associative
logic
array
or
PALA
The
MMI
5760
was
completed
in
1976
and
could
implement
multilevel
or
sequential
circuits
of
over
100
gates
The
device
was
supported
by
a
GE
design
environment
where
Boolean
equations
would
be
converted
to
mask
patterns
for
configuring
the
device
The
part
was
never
brought
to

In
1970
Texas
Instruments
developed
a
mask-programmable
IC
based
on
the
IBM
read-only
associative
memory
or
ROAM
This
device
the
TMS
2000
was
programmed
by
altering
the
metal
layer
during
the
production
of
the
IC
The
TMS
2000
had
up
to
17
inputs
and
18
outputs
with
8
JK
flip-flops
for
memory
TI
coined
the
term
programmable
logic
array
for
this
device

A
programmable
logic
array
PLA
has
a
programmable
AND
gate
array
which
links
to
a
programmable
OR
gate
array
which
can
then
be
conditionally
complemented
to
produce
an
output
A
PLA
is
similar
to
a
ROM
concept
however
a
PLA
does
not
provide
full
decoding
of
a
variable
and
does
not
generate
all
the
minterms
as
in
a

PAL

Programmable

logic
PAL
devices
have
arrays
of
transistor
cells
arranged
in
a
fixed-OR
programmable-AND
plane
used
to
implement
sum-of-products
binary
logic
equations
for
each
of
the
outputs
in
terms
of
the
inputs
and
either
synchronous
or
asynchronous
feedback
from
the
outputs
MMI
introduced
a
breakthrough
device
in
1978
the
programmable
array
logic
or
PAL
The
architecture
was
simpler
than
that
of
Signetics
FPLA
because
it
omitted
the
programmable
OR
array
This
made
the
parts
faster
smaller
and
cheaper
They
were
available
in
20
pin
300
mil
DIP
packages
while
the
FPLAs
came
in
28
pin
600
mil
packages
The
PAL
Handbook
demystified
the
design
process
The
PALASM
design
software
PAL
assembler
converted
the
engineers
Boolean
equations
into
the
fuse
pattern
required
to
program
the
part
The
PAL
devices
were
soon
second-sourced
by
National
Semiconductor
Texas
Instruments
and
AMD
After
MMI
succeeded
with
the
20
pin
PAL
parts
AMD
introduced
the
24
pin
22
V
10
PAL
with
additional
features
After
buying
out
MMI
1987
AMD
spun
off
a
consolidated
operation
as
Vantis
and
that
business
was
acquired
by
Lattice
Semiconductor
in
1999

An
improvement
on
the
PAL
was
the
generic
array
logic
device
or
GAL
invented
by
Lattice
Semiconductor
in
1985
This
device
has
the
same
logical
properties
as
the
PAL
but
can
be
erased
and
reprogrammed
The
GAL
is
very
useful
in
the
prototyping
stage
of
a
design
when
any
bugs
in
the
logic
can
be
corrected
by
reprogramming
GALs
are
programmed
and
reprogrammed
using
a
PAL
programmer
or
in
the
case
of
chips
that
support
it
by
using
the
in-circuit

technique
Lattice
GALs
combine
CMOS
and
electrically
erasable
E

floating

technology
for
a
high-speed
low-power
logic
device
A
similar
device
called
a
PEEL
programmable
electrically
erasable
logic
was
introduced
by
the
International
CMOS
Technology
ICT
corporation
Sometimes
GAL
chips
are
referred
as
simple
programmable

device
SPLD
analogous
to
complex

CPLDs
edit
Main
article
Complex
programmable
logic
device
PALs
and
GALs
are
available
only
in
small
sizes
equivalent
to
a
few
hundred
logic
gates
For
bigger
logic
circuits
complex
PLDs
or
CPLDs
can
be
used
These
contain
the
equivalent
of
several
PALs
linked
by
programmable
interconnections
all
in
one
integrated
circuit
CPLDs
can
replace
thousands
or
even
hundreds
of
thousands
of
logic
gates
Some
CPLDs
are
programmed
using
a
PAL
programmer
but
this
method
becomes
inconvenient
for
devices
with
hundreds
of
pins
A
second
method
of
programming
is
to
solder
the
device
to
its
printed
circuit
board
then
feed
it
with
a
serial
data
stream
from
a
personal
computer
The
CPLD
contains
a
circuit
that
decodes
the
data
stream
and
configures
the
CPLD
to
perform
its
specified
logic
function
Some
manufacturers
such
as
Altera
and
Atmel
now
Microchip
use
JTAG
to
program
CPLDs
in-circuit
from
JAM
files
FPGAs
edit
Main
article
Field-programmable
gate
array
While
PALs
were
being
developed
into
GALs
and
CPLDs
all
discussed
above
a
separate
stream
of
development
was
happening
This
type
of
device
is
based
on
gate
array
technology
and
is
called
the
field-programmable
gate
array
FPGA
Early
examples
of
FPGAs
are
the
82
S
100
array
and
82
S
105
sequencer
by
Signetics
introduced
in
the
late
1970
s
The
82
S
100
was
an
array
of
AND
terms
The
82
S
105
also
had
flip-flop
functions
Remark
82
S
100
and
similar
ICs
from
Signetics
have
PLA
structure
AND-plane
OR-plane
FPGAs
use
a
grid
of
logic
gates
and
once
stored
the
data
doesn't
change
similar
to
that
of
an
ordinary
gate
array
The
term
field-programmable
means
the
device
is
programmed
by
the
customer
not
the
manufacturer
FPGAs
and
gate
arrays
are
similar
but
gate
arrays
can
only
be
configured
at
the
factory
during
fabrication
11
12
13
FPGAs
are
usually
programmed
after
being
soldered
down
to
the
circuit
board
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
of
larger
CPLDs
In
most
larger
FPGAs
the
configuration
is
volatile
and
must
be
re-loaded
into
the
device
whenever
power
is
applied
or
different
functionality
is
required
Configuration
is
typically
stored
in
a
configuration
PROM
EEPROM
or
flash
memory
14
EEPROM
versions
may
be
in-system
programmable
typically
via
JTAG
The
difference
between
FPGAs
and
CPLDs
is
that
FPGAs
are
internally
based
on
look-up
tables
LUTs
whereas
CPLDs
form
the
logic
functions
with
sea-of-gates
e.g
sum
of
products
CPLDs
are
meant
for
simpler
designs
while
FPGAs
are
meant
for
more
complex
designs
In
general
CPLDs
are
a
good
choice
for
wide
combinational
logic
applications
whereas
FPGAs
are
more
suitable
for
large
state
machines
such
as
microprocessors

These
are
microprocessor
circuits
that
contain
some
fixed
functions
and
other
functions
that
can
be
altered
by
code
running
on
the
processor
Designing
self-altering
systems
requires
that
engineers
learn
new
methods
and
that
new
software
tools
be
developed
PLDs
are
being
sold
now
that
contain
a
microprocessor
with
a
fixed
function
the
so-called
core
surrounded
by
programmable
logic
These
devices
let
designers
concentrate
on
adding
new
features
to
designs
without
having
to
worry
about
making
the
microprocessor
work
Also
the
fixed-function
microprocessor
takes
less
space
on
the
chip
than
a
part
of
the
programmable
gate
array
implementing
the
same

leaving
more
space
for
the
programmable

array
to
contain
the
designer's
specialized

How
PLDs
retain
their
configuration
edit
A
PLD
is
a
combination
of
a
logic
device
and
a
memory
device
The
memory
is
used
to
store
the
pattern
that
was
given
to
the
chip
during
programming
Most
of
the
methods
for
storing
data
in
an
integrated
circuit
have
been
adapted
for
use
in
PLDs
These
include
Silicon
antifuses
SRAM
EPROM
or
EEPROM
memory
cells
Flash
memory
Silicon
antifuses
are
connections
that
are
made
by
applying
a
voltage
across
a
modified
area
of
silicon
inside
the
chip
They
are
called
antifuses
because
they
work
in
the
opposite
way
to
normal
fuses
which
begin
life
as
connections
until
they
are
broken
by
an
electric
current
SRAM
or
static
RAM
is
a
volatile
type
of
memory
meaning
that
its
contents
are
lost
each
time
the
power
is
switched
off
SRAM-based
PLDs
therefore
have
to
be
programmed
every
time
the
circuit
is
switched
on
This
is
usually
done
automatically
by
another
part
of
the
circuit
An
EPROM
memory
cell
is
a
MOSFET
metal-oxide
semiconductor
field-effect
transistor
or
MOS
transistor
that
can
be
switched
on
by
trapping
an
electric
charge
permanently
on
its
gate
electrode
This
is
done
by
a
PAL
programmer
The
charge
remains
for
many
years
and
can
only
be
removed
by
exposing
the
chip
to
strong
ultraviolet
light
in
a
device
called
an
EPROM
eraser
Flash
memory
is
non-volatile
retaining
its
contents
even
when
the
power
is
switched
off
It
is
stored
on
floating-gate
MOSFET
memory
cells
and
can
be
erased
and
reprogrammed
as
required
This
makes
it
useful
in
PLDs
that
may
be
reprogrammed
frequently
such
as
PLDs
used
in
prototypes
Flash
memory
is
a
kind
of
EEPROM
that
holds
information
using
trapped
electric
charges
similar
to
EPROM
Consequently
flash
memory
can
hold
information
for
years
but
possibly
not
as
many
years
as
EPROM
As
of
2005
most
CPLDs
are
electrically
programmable
and
erasable
and
non-volatile
This
is
because
they
are
too
small
to
justify
the
inconvenience
of
programming
internal
SRAM
cells
every
time
they
start
up
and
EPROM
cells
are
more
expensive
due
to
their
ceramic
package
with
a
quartz
window

A

programmer
is
used
to
transfer
the
Boolean
logic
pattern
into
the

In
the
early
days
of

every
PLD
manufacturer
also
produced
a
specialized

programmer
for
its
family
of
logic

Later
universal

came
onto
the

that
supported
several

Programming
paradigm
based
on
formal
logic
Logic
programming
is
a
programming
database
and
knowledge
representation
paradigm
based
on
formal
logic
A
logic
program
is
a
set
of
sentences
in
logical
form
representing
knowledge
about
some
problem
domain
Computation
is
performed
by
applying
logical
reasoning
to
that
knowledge
to
solve
problems
in
the
domain
Major
logic
programming
language
families
include
Prolog
Answer
Set
Programming
ASP
and
Datalog
In
all
of
these
languages
rules
are
written
in
the
form
of
clauses
A
B
1
B[n
and
are
read
as
declarative
sentences
in
logical
form
A
if
B
1
and
and
B[n
A
is
called
the
head
of
the
rule
B
1
B[n
is
called
the
body
and
the
B[i
are
called
literals
or
conditions
When
n
0
the
rule
is
called
a
fact
and
is
written
in
the
simplified
form
A
Queries
or
goals
have
the
same
syntax
as
the
bodies
of
rules
and
are
commonly
written
in
the
form
B
1
B[n
In
the
simplest
case
of
Horn
clauses
or
definite
clauses
all
of
the
A
B
1
B[n
are
atomic
formulae
of
the
form
p(t
1
t[m
where
p
is
a
predicate
symbol
naming
a
relation
like
motherhood
and
the
t[i
are
terms
naming
objects
or
individuals
Terms
include
both
constant
symbols
like
charles
and
variables
such
as
X
which
start
with
an
upper
case
letter
Consider
for
example
the
following
Horn
clause
program
mother_child(elizabeth
charles
father_child(charles
william
father_child(charles
harry
parent_child(X
Y
mother_child(X
Y
parent_child(X
Y
father_child(X
Y
grandparent_child(X
Y
parent_child(X
Z
parent_child(Z
Y
Given
a
query
the
program
produces
answers
For
instance
for
a
query
parent_child(X
william
the
single
answer
is
X
charles
Various
queries
can
be
asked
For
instance
the
program
can
be
queried
both
to
generate
grandparents
and
to
generate
grandchildren
It
can
even
be
used
to
generate
all
pairs
of
grandchildren
and
grandparents
or
simply
to
check
if
a
given
pair
is
such
a
pair
grandparent_child(X
william
X
elizabeth
grandparent_child(elizabeth
Y
Y
william
Y
harry
grandparent_child(X
Y
X
elizabeth
Y
william
X
elizabeth
Y
harry
grandparent_child(william
harry
no
grandparent_child(elizabeth
harry
yes
Although
Horn
clause
logic
programs
are
Turing
complete
1
2
for
most
practical
applications
Horn
clause
programs
need
to
be
extended
to
normal
logic
programs
with
negative
conditions
For
example
the
definition
of
sibling
uses
a
negative
condition
where
the
predicate
is
defined
by
the
clause
X
X
sibling(X
Y
parent_child(Z
X
parent_child(Z
Y
not(X
Y
Logic
programming
languages
that
include
negative
conditions
have
the
knowledge
representation
capabilities
of
a
non-monotonic
logic
In
ASP
and
Datalog
logic
programs
have
only
a
declarative
reading
and
their
execution
is
performed
by
means
of
a
proof
procedure
or
model
generator
whose
behaviour
is
not
meant
to
be
controlled
by
the
programmer
However
in
the
Prolog
family
of
languages
logic
programs
also
have
a
procedural
interpretation
as
goal-reduction
procedures
From
this
point
of
view
clause
A
B
1
B[n
is
understood
as
to
solve
A
solve
B
1
and
and
solve
B[n
Negative
conditions
in
the
bodies
of
clauses
also
have
a
procedural
interpretation
known
as
negation
as
failure
A
negative
literal
not
B
is
deemed
to
hold
if
and
only
if
the
positive
literal
B
fails
to
hold
Much
of
the
research
in
the
field
of
logic
programming
has
been
concerned
with
trying
to
develop
a
logical
semantics
for
negation
as
failure
and
with
developing
other
semantics
and
other
implementations
for
negation
These
developments
have
been
important
in
turn
for
supporting
the
development
of
formal
methods
for
logic-based
program
verification
and
program
transformation
History
edit
The
use
of
mathematical
logic
to
represent
and
execute
computer
programs
is
also
a
feature
of
the
lambda
calculus
developed
by
Alonzo
Church
in
the
1930
s
However
the
first
proposal
to
use
the
clausal
form
of
logic
for
representing
computer
programs
was
made
by
Cordell
Green
3
This
used
an
axiomatization
of
a
subset
of
LISP
together
with
a
representation
of
an
input-output
relation
to
compute
the
relation
by
simulating
the
execution
of
the
program
in
LISP
Foster
and
Elcock's
Absys
on
the
other
hand
employed
a
combination
of
equations
and
lambda
calculus
in
an
assertional
programming
language
that
places
no
constraints
on
the
order
in
which
operations
are
performed
4
Logic
programming
with
its
current
syntax
of
facts
and
rules
can
be
traced
back
to
debates
in
the
late
1960
s
and
early
1970
s
about
declarative
versus
procedural
representations
of
knowledge
in
artificial
intelligence
Advocates
of
declarative
representations
were
notably
working
at
Stanford
associated
with
John
McCarthy
Bertram
Raphael
and
Cordell
Green
and
in
Edinburgh
with
John
Alan
Robinson
an
academic
visitor
from
Syracuse
University
Pat
Hayes
and
Robert
Kowalski
Advocates
of
procedural
representations
were
mainly
centered
at
MIT
under
the
leadership
of
Marvin
Minsky
and
Seymour
Papert
5
Although
it
was
based
on
the
proof
methods
of
logic
Planner
developed
by
Carl
Hewitt
at
MIT
was
the
first
language
to
emerge
within
this
proceduralist
paradigm
6
Planner
featured
pattern-directed
invocation
of
procedural
plans
from
goals
i.e
goal-reduction
or
backward
chaining
and
from
assertions
i.e
forward
chaining
The
most
influential
implementation
of
Planner
was
the
subset
of
Planner
called
Micro-Planner
implemented
by
Gerry
Sussman
Eugene
Charniak
and
Terry
Winograd
Winograd
used
Micro-Planner
to
implement
the
landmark
natural-language
understanding
program
SHRDLU
7
For
the
sake
of
efficiency
Planner
used
a
backtracking
control
structure
so
that
only
one
possible
computation
path
had
to
be
stored
at
a
time
Planner
gave
rise
to
the
programming
languages

Hayes
and
Kowalski
in
Edinburgh
tried
to
reconcile
the
logic-based
declarative
approach
to
knowledge
representation
with
Planner's
procedural
approach
Hayes
1973
developed
an
equational
language
Golux
in
which
different
procedures
could
be
obtained
by
altering
the
behavior
of
the
theorem
prover
13
In
the
meanwhile
Alain
Colmerauer
in
Marseille
was
working
on
natural-language
understanding
using
logic
to
represent
semantics
and
using
resolution
for
question-answering
During
the
summer
of
1971
Colmerauer
invited
Kowalski
to
Marseille
and
together
they
discovered
that
the
clausal
form
of
logic
could
be
used
to
represent
formal
grammars
and
that
resolution
theorem
provers
could
be
used
for
parsing
They
observed
that
some
theorem
provers
like
hyper-resolution
14
behave
as
bottom-up
parsers
and
others
like
SL
resolution
1971
15
behave
as
top-down
parsers
It
was
in
the
following
summer
of
1972
that
Kowalski
again
working
with
Colmerauer
developed
the
procedural
interpretation
of
implications
in
clausal
form
It
also
became
clear
that
such
clauses
could
be
restricted
to
definite
clauses
or
Horn
clauses
and
that
SL-resolution
could
be
restricted
and
generalised
to
SLD
resolution
Kowalski's
procedural
interpretation
and
SLD
were
described
in
a
1973
memo
published
in
1974
16
Colmerauer
with
Philippe
Roussel
used
the
procedural
interpretation
as
the
basis
of
Prolog
which
was
implemented
in
the
summer
and
autumn
of
1972
The
first
Prolog
program
also
written
in
1972
and
implemented
in
Marseille
was
a
French
question-answering
system
The
use
of
Prolog
as
a
practical
programming
language
was
given
great
momentum
by
the
development
of
a
compiler
by
David
H
D
Warren
in
Edinburgh
in
1977
Experiments
demonstrated
that
Edinburgh
Prolog
could
compete
with
the
processing
speed
of
other
symbolic
programming
languages
such
as
Lisp
17
Edinburgh
Prolog
became
the
de
facto
standard
and
strongly
influenced
the
definition
of
ISO
standard
Prolog
Logic
programming
gained
international
attention
during
the
1980
s
when
it
was
chosen
by
the
Japanese
Ministry
of
International
Trade
and
Industry
to
develop
the
software
for
the
Fifth
Generation
Computer
Systems
FGCS
project
The
FGCS
project
aimed
to
use
logic
programming
to
develop
advanced
Artificial
Intelligence
applications
on
massively
parallel
computers
Although
the
project
initially
explored
the
use
of
Prolog
it
later
adopted
the
use
of
concurrent
logic
programming
because
it
was
closer
to
the
FGCS
computer
architecture
However
the
committed
choice
feature
of
concurrent
logic
programming
interfered
with
the
language's
logical
semantics
18
and
with
its
suitability
for
knowledge
representation
and
problem
solving
applications
Moreover
the
parallel
computer
systems
developed
in
the
project
failed
to
compete
with
advances
taking
place
in
the
development
of
more
conventional
general-purpose
computers
Together
these
two
issues
resulted
in
the
FGCS
project
failing
to
meet
its
objectives
Interest
in
both
logic
programming
and
AI
fell
into
world-wide
decline
19
In
the
meanwhile
more
declarative
logic
programming
approaches
including
those
based
on
the
use
of
Prolog
continued
to
make
progress
independently
of
the
FGCS
project
In
particular
although
Prolog
was
developed
to
combine
declarative
and
procedural
representations
of
knowledge
the
purely
declarative
interpretation
of
logic
programs
became
the
focus
for
applications
in
the
field
of
deductive
databases
Work
in
this
field
became
prominent
around
1977
when
Hervé
Gallaire
and
Jack
Minker
organized
a
workshop
on
logic
and
databases
in
Toulouse
20
The
field
was
eventually
renamed
as
Datalog
This
focus
on
the
logical
declarative
reading
of
logic
programs
was
given
further
impetus
by
the
development
of
constraint
logic
programming
in
the
1980
s
and
Answer
Set
Programming
in
the
1990
s
It
is
also
receiving
renewed
emphasis
in
recent
applications
of
Prolog
21
The
Association
for
Logic
Programming
ALP
was
founded
in
1986
to
promote
Logic
Programming
Its
official
journal
until
2000
was
The
Journal
of
Logic
Programming
Its
founding
editor-in-chief
was
J
Alan
Robinson
22
In
2001
the
journal
was
renamed
The
Journal
of
Logic

and
the
official

of

became

Algorithm
Logic
Control
edit
The
procedural
interpretation
of
logic
programs
which
uses
backward
reasoning
to
reduce
goals
to
subgoals
is
a
special
case
of
the
use
of
a
problem-solving
strategy
to
control
the
use
of
a
declarative
logical
representation
of
knowledge
to
obtain
the
behaviour
of
an
algorithm
More
generally
different
problem-solving
strategies
can
be
applied
to
the
same
logical
representation
to
obtain
different
algorithms
Alternatively
different
algorithms
can
be
obtained
with
a
given
problem-solving
strategy
by
using
different
logical
representations
23
The
two
main
problem-solving
strategies
are
backward
reasoning
goal
reduction
and
forward
reasoning
also
known
as
top-down
and
bottom-up
reasoning
respectively
In
the
simple
case
of
a
propositional
Horn
clause
program
and
a
top-level
atomic
goal
backward
reasoning
determines
an
and-or
tree
which
constitutes
the
search
space
for
solving
the
goal
The
top-level
goal
is
the
root
of
the
tree
Given
any
node
in
the
tree
and
any
clause
whose
head
matches
the
node
there
exists
a
set
of
child
nodes
corresponding
to
the
sub-goals
in
the
body
of
the
clause
These
child
nodes
are
grouped
together
by
an
and
The
alternative
sets
of
children
corresponding
to
alternative
ways
of
solving
the
node
are
grouped
together
by
an
or
Any
search
strategy
can
be
used
to
search
this
space
Prolog
uses
a
sequential
last-in-first-out
backtracking
strategy
in
which
only
one
alternative
and
one
sub-goal
are
considered
at
a
time
For
example
subgoals
can
be
solved
in
parallel
and
clauses
can
also
be
tried
in
parallel
The
first
strategy
is
called
and-parallel
and
the
second
strategy
is
called
or-parallel
Other
search
strategies
such
as
intelligent
backtracking
24
or
best-first
search
to
find
an
optimal
solution
25
are
also
possible
In
the
more
general
non-propositional
case
where
sub-goals
can
share
variables
other
strategies
can
be
used
such
as
choosing
the
subgoal
that
is
most
highly
instantiated
or
that
is
sufficiently
instantiated
so
that
only
one
procedure
applies
26
Such
strategies
are
used
for
example
in
concurrent
logic
programming
In
most
cases
backward
reasoning
from
a
query
or
goal
is
more
efficient
than
forward
reasoning
But
sometimes
with
Datalog
and
Answer
Set
Programming
there
may
be
no
query
that
is
separate
from
the
set
of
clauses
as
a
whole
and
then
generating
all
the
facts
that
can
be
derived
from
the
clauses
is
a
sensible
problem-solving
strategy
Here
is
another
example
where
forward
reasoning
beats
backward
reasoning
in
a
more
conventional
computation
task
where
the
goal
fibonacci(n
Result
is
to
find
the
n
th
fibonacci
number
fibonacci
0

fibonacci

fibonacci(N
Result
N

N

is

N
2
is
N
2
fibonacci(N

F

fibonacci(N
2
F
2
Result
is
F
1
F
2
Here
the
relation
fibonacci(N
M
stands
for
the
function
fibonacci(N
M
and
the
predicate
N
is
Expression
is
Prolog
notation
for
the
predicate
that
instantiates
the
variable
N
to
the
value
of
Expression
Given
the
goal
of
computing
the
fibonacci
number
of
n
backward
reasoning
reduces
the
goal
to
the
two
subgoals
of
computing
the
fibonacci
numbers
of
n
1
and
n
2
It
reduces
the
subgoal
of
computing
the
fibonacci
number
of
n
1
to
the
two
subgoals
of
computing
the
fibonacci
numbers
of
n
2
and
n
3
redundantly
computing
the
fibonacci
number
of
n
2
This
process
of
reducing
one
fibonacci
subgoal
to
two
fibonacci
subgoals
continues
until
it
reaches
the
numbers
0
and
1
Its
complexity
is
of
the
order
2
n
In
contrast
forward
reasoning
generates
the
sequence
of
fibonacci
numbers
starting
from
0
and
1
without
any
recomputation
and
its
complexity
is
linear
with
respect
to
n
Prolog
cannot
perform
forward
reasoning
directly
But
it
can
achieve
the
effect
of
forward
reasoning
within
the
context
of
backward
reasoning
by
means
of
tabling
Subgoals
are
maintained
in
a
table
along
with
their
solutions
If
a
subgoal
is
re-encountered
it
is
solved
directly
by
using
the
solutions
already
in
the
table
instead
of
re-solving
the
subgoals
redundantly

Relationship
with
functional
programming

Functional
programming
Comparison
to
logic
programming
Logic
programming
can
be
viewed
as
a
generalisation
of
functional
programming
in
which
functions
are
a
special
case
of
relations
28
For
example
the
function
mother(X
Y
every
X
has
only
one
mother
Y
can
be
represented
by
the
relation
mother(X
Y
In
this
respect
logic
programs
are
similar
to
relational
databases
which
also
represent
functions
as
relations
Compared
with
relational
syntax
functional
syntax
is
more
compact
for
nested
functions
For
example
in
functional
syntax
the
definition
of
maternal
grandmother
can
be
written
in
the
nested
form
maternal_grandmother(X
mother(mother(X
The
same
definition
in
relational
notation
needs
to
be
written
in
the
unnested
flattened
form
maternal_grandmother(X
Y
mother(X
Z
mother(Z
Y
However
nested
syntax
can
be
regarded
as
syntactic
sugar
for
unnested
syntax
Ciao
Prolog
for
example
transforms
functional
syntax
into
relational
form
and
executes
the
resulting
logic
program
using
the
standard
Prolog
execution
strategy
29
Moreover
the
same
transformation
can
be
used
to
execute
nested
relations
that
are
not
functional
For
example
grandparent(X
parent(parent(X
parent(X
mother(X
parent(X
father(X
mother(charles
elizabeth
father(charles
phillip
mother(harry
diana
father(harry

grandparent(X,Y

Relationship
with
relational
programming

The
term
relational
programming
has
been
used
to
cover
a
variety
of
programming
languages
that
treat
functions
as
a
special
case
of
relations
Some
of
these
languages
such
as
miniKanren
28
and
relational
linear
programming
30
are
logic
programming
languages
in
the
sense
of
this
article
However
the
relational
language
RML
is
an
imperative
programming
language
31
whose
core
construct
is
a
relational
expression
which
is
similar
to
an
expression
in
first-order
predicate
logic
Other
relational
programming
languages
are
based
on
the
relational
calculus
32
or
relational
algebra

Semantics
of
Horn
clause
programs
edit
Main
article
Syntax
and
semantics
of
logic
programming
Viewed
in
purely
logical
terms
there
are
two
approaches
to
the
declarative
semantics
of
Horn
clause
logic
programs
One
approach
is
the
original
logical
consequence
semantics
which
understands
solving
a
goal
as
showing
that
the
goal
is
a
theorem
that
is
true
in
all
models
of
the
program
In
this
approach
computation
is
theorem-proving
in
first-order
logic
and
both
backward
reasoning
as
in
SLD
resolution
and
forward
reasoning
as
in
hyper-resolution
are
correct
and
complete
theorem-proving
methods
Sometimes
such
theorem-proving
methods
are
also
regarded
as
providing
a
separate
proof-theoretic
or
operational
semantics
for
logic
programs
But
from
a
logical
point
of
view
they
are
proof
methods
rather
than
semantics
The
other
approach
to
the
declarative
semantics
of
Horn
clause
programs
is
the
satisfiability
semantics
which
understands
solving
a
goal
as
showing
that
the
goal
is
true
or
satisfied
in
some
intended
or
standard
model
of
the
program
For
Horn
clause
programs
there
always
exists
such
a
standard
model
It
is
the
unique
minimal
model
of
the
program
Informally
speaking
a
minimal
model
is
a
model
that
when
it
is
viewed
as
the
set
of
all
variable-free
facts
that
are
true
in
the
model
contains
no
smaller
set
of
facts
that
is
also
a
model
of
the
program
For
example
the
following
facts
represent
the
minimal
model
of
the
family
relationships
example
in
the
introduction
of
this
article
All
other
variable-free
facts
are
false
in
the
model
mother_child(elizabeth
charles
father_child(charles
william
father_child(charles
harry
parent_child(elizabeth
charles
parent_child(charles
william
parent_child(charles
harry
grandparent_child(elizabeth
william
grandparent_child(elizabeth
harry
The
satisfiability
semantics
also
has
an
alternative
more
mathematical
characterisation
as
the
least
fixed
point
of
the
function
that
uses
the
rules
in
the
program
to
derive
new
facts
from
existing
facts
in
one
step
of
inference
Remarkably
the
same
problem-solving
methods
of
forward
and
backward
reasoning
which
were
originally
developed
for
the
logical
consequence
semantics
are
equally
applicable
to
the
satisfiability
semantics
Forward
reasoning
generates
the
minimal
model
of
a
Horn
clause
program
by
deriving
new
facts
from
existing
facts
until
no
new
additional
facts
can
be
generated
Backward
reasoning
which
succeeds
by
reducing
a
goal
to
subgoals
until
all
subgoals
are
solved
by
facts
ensures
that
the
goal
is
true
in
the
minimal
model
without
generating
the
model
explicitly
34
The
difference
between
the
two
declarative
semantics
can
be
seen
with
the
definitions
of
addition
and
multiplication
in
successor
arithmetic
which
represents
the
natural
numbers
0
1
2
as
a
sequence
of
terms
of
the
form
0
s
0
s(s
0
In
general
the
term
s(X
represents
the
successor
of
X
namely
X
1
Here
are
the
standard
definitions
of
addition
and
multiplication
in
functional
notation
X
0
X
X
s(Y
s(X
Y
i.e
X
Y
1
X
Y

X
0

X
s(Y
X
X
Y
i.e
X
Y
1
X
X
Y
Here
are
the
same
definitions
as
a
logic
program
using
add(X
Y
Z
to
represent
X
Y
Z
and
multiply(X
Y
Z
to
represent
X
Y
Z
add(X
0
X
add(X
s(Y
s(Z
add(X
Y
Z
multiply(X
0
0
multiply(X
s(Y
W
multiply(X
Y
Z
add(X
Z
W
The
two
declarative
semantics
both
give
the
same
answers
for
the
same
existentially
quantified
conjunctions
of
addition
and
multiplication
goals
For
example
2
2
X
has
the
solution
X
4
and
X
X
X
X
has
two
solutions
X
0
and
X
2
multiply(s(s
0
s(s
0
X
X
s(s(s(s
0
multiply(X
X
Y
add(X
X
Y
X
0
Y
0
X
s(s
0
Y
s(s(s(s
0
However
with
the
logical-consequence
semantics
there
are
non-standard
models
of
the
program
in
which
for
example
add(s(s
0
s(s
0
s(s(s(s(s
0
i.e
2
2
5
is
true
But
with
the
satisfiability
semantics
there
is
only
one
model
namely
the
standard
model
of
arithmetic
in
which
2
2
5
is
false
In
both
semantics
the
goal
add(s(s
0
s(s
0
s(s(s(s(s
0
fails
In
the
satisfiability
semantics
the
failure
of
the
goal
means
that
the
truth
value
of
the
goal
is
false
But
in
the
logical
consequence
semantics
the
failure
means
that
the
truth
value
of
the
goal
is
unknown
Negation

failure

Negation

Negation
as

NAF
as
a
way
of
concluding
that
a
negative
condition
not
p
holds
by
showing
that
the
positive
condition
p
fails
to
hold
was
already
a
feature
of
early
Prolog
systems
The
resulting
extension
of
SLD
resolution
is
called
SLDNF
A
similar
construct
called
thnot
also
existed
in
Micro-Planner
The
logical
semantics
of
NAF
was
unresolved
until
Keith
Clark
35
showed
that
under
certain
natural
conditions
NAF
is
an
efficient
correct
and
sometimes
complete
way
of
reasoning
with
the
logical
consequence
semantics
using
the
completion
of
a
logic
program
in
first-order
logic
Completion
amounts
roughly
to
regarding
the
set
of
all
the
program
clauses
with
the
same
predicate
in
the
head
say
A
Body
1
A
Body[k
as
a
definition
of
the
predicate
A
iff
Body
1
or
or
Body[k
where
iff
means
if
and
only
if
The
completion
also
includes
axioms
of
equality
which
correspond
to
unification
Clark
showed
that
proofs
generated
by
SLDNF
are
structurally
similar
to
proofs
generated
by
a
natural
deduction
style
of
reasoning
with
the
completion
of
the
program
Consider
for
example
the
following
program
should_receive_sanction(X
punishment
is_a_thief(X
not
should_receive_sanction(X
rehabilitation
should_receive_sanction(X
rehabilitation
is_a_thief(X
is_a_minor(X
not
is_violent(X
is_a_thief(tom
Given
the
goal
of
determining
whether
tom
should
receive
a
sanction
the
first
rule
succeeds
in
showing
that
tom
should
be
punished
should_receive_sanction(tom
Sanction
Sanction
punishment
This
is
because
tom
is
a
thief
and
it
cannot
be
shown
that
tom
should
be
rehabilitated
It
cannot
be
shown
that
tom
should
be
rehabilitated
because
it
cannot
be
shown
that
tom
is
a
minor
If
however
we
receive
new
information
that
tom
is
indeed
a
minor
the
previous
conclusion
that
tom
should
be
punished
is
replaced
by
the
new
conclusion
that
tom
should
be
rehabilitated
minor(tom
should_receive_sanction(tom
Sanction
Sanction
rehabilitation
This
property
of
withdrawing
a
conclusion
when
new
information
is
added
is
called
non-monotonicity
and
it
makes
logic
programming
a
non-monotonic
logic
But
if
we
are
now
told
that
tom
is
violent
the
conclusion
that
tom
should
be
punished
will
be
reinstated
violent(tom
should_receive_sanction(tom
Sanction
Sanction
punishment
The
completion
of
this
program
is
should_receive_sanction(X
Sanction
iff
Sanction
punishment
is_a_thief(X
not
should_receive_sanction(X
rehabilitation
or
Sanction
rehabilitation
is_a_thief(X
is_a_minor(X
not
is_violent(X
is_a_thief(X
iff
X
tom
is_a_minor(X
iff
X
tom
is_violent(X
iff
X
tom
The
notion
of
completion
is
closely
related
to
John
McCarthy's
circumscription
semantics
for
default
reasoning
36
and
to
Ray
Reiter's
closed
world
assumption
37
The
completion
semantics
for
negation
is
a
logical
consequence
semantics
for
which
SLDNF
provides
a
proof-theoretic
implementation
However
in
the
1980
s
the
satisfiability
semantics
became
more
popular
for
logic
programs
with
negation
In
the
satisfiability
semantics
negation
is
interpreted
according
to
the
classical
definition
of
truth
in
an
intended
or
standard
model
of
the
logic
program
In
the
case
of
logic
programs
with
negative
conditions
there
are
two
main
variants
of
the
satisfiability
semantics
In
the
well-founded
semantics
the
intended
model
of
a
logic
program
is
a
unique
three-valued
minimal
model
which
always
exists
The
well-founded
semantics
generalises
the
notion
of
inductive
definition
in
mathematical
logic
38
XSB
Prolog
39
implements
the
well-founded
semantics
using
SLG
resolution
40
In
the
alternative
stable
model
semantics
there
may
be
no
intended
models
or
several
intended
models
all
of
which
are
minimal
and
two-valued
The
stable
model
semantics
underpins
answer
set
programming
ASP
Both
the
well-founded
and
stable
model
semantics
apply
to
arbitrary
logic
programs
with
negation
However
both
semantics
coincide
for
stratified
logic
programs
For
example
the
program
for
sanctioning
thieves
is
locally
stratified
and
all
three
semantics
for
the
program
determine
the
same
intended
model
should_receive_sanction(tom
punishment
is_a_thief(tom
is_a_minor(tom
is_violent(tom
Attempts
to
understand
negation
in
logic
programming
have
also
contributed
to
the
development
of
abstract
argumentation
frameworks
41
In
an
argumentation
interpretation
of
negation
the
initial
argument
that
tom
should
be
punished
because
he
is
a
thief
is
attacked
by
the
argument
that
he
should
be
rehabilitated
because
he
is
a
minor
But
the
fact
that
tom
is
violent
undermines
the
argument
that
tom
should
be
rehabilitated
and
reinstates
the
argument
that
tom
should
be
punished
Metalogic
programming
edit
Metaprogramming
in
which
programs
are
treated
as
data
was
already
a
feature
of
early
Prolog
implementations
42
43
For
example
the
Edinburgh
DEC
10
implementation
of
Prolog
included
an
interpreter
and
a
compiler
both
written
in
Prolog
itself
43
The
simplest
metaprogram
is
the
so-called
vanilla
meta-interpreter
solve(true
solve
B,C
solve(B
solve(C
solve(A
clause(A,B
solve(B
where
true
represents
an
empty
conjunction
and
B,C
is
a
composite
term
representing
the
conjunction
of
B
and
C
The
predicate
clause(A,B
means
that
there
is
a
clause
of
the
form
A
B
Metaprogramming
is
an
application
of
the
more
general
use
of
a
metalogic
or
metalanguage
to
describe
and
reason
about
another
language
called
the
object
language
Metalogic
programming
allows
object-level
and
metalevel
representations
to
be
combined
as
in
natural
language
For
example
in
the
following
program
the
atomic
formula
attends(Person
Meeting
occurs
both
as
an
object-level
formula
and
as
an
argument
of
the
metapredicates
prohibited
and
approved
prohibited(attends(Person
Meeting
not(approved(attends(Person
Meeting
should_receive_sanction(Person
scolding
attends(Person

lofty(Person
prohibited(attends(Person

In

Introduction

as
alternative
approaches
to

He
argues
that
rules
which
have
the
form
IF
condition
THEN

are
very
similar
to
logical
conditionals
but
they
are
simpler
and
have
greater
psychological
plausability

Among
other
differences
between
logic
and
rules
he
argues
that
logic
uses
deduction

rules
use
search

45
and
can
be
used
to
reason
either
forward

backward

Sentences
in
logic
have
to
be
interpreted
as
universally
true
but
rules
can
be
defaults
which
admit
exceptions

He
states
that
unlike
logic
rule-based
systems

also
easily
represent

example
IF
you
want
to
go
home
for
the
weekend
and
you
have

fare
THEN
you
can
catch
a
bus
He
does
not
observe
that
the
same
strategy
of
reducing
a
goal
to
subgoals
can
be
interpreted
in
the
manner
of
logic
programming
as
applying
backward
reasoning

Knowledge
representation
edit
The
use
of
logic
to
represent
procedural
knowledge
and
strategic
information
was
one
of
the
main
goals
contributing
to
the
early
development
of
logic
programming
Moreover
it
continues
to
be
an
important
feature
of
the
Prolog
family
of
logic
programming
languages
today
However
many
applications
of
logic
programming
including
Prolog
applications
increasingly
focus
on
the
use
of
logic
to
represent
purely
declarative
knowledge
These
applications
include
both
the
representation
of
general
commonsense
knowledge
and
the
representation
of
domain
specific
expertise
Commonsense
includes
knowledge
about
cause
and
effect
as
formalised
for
example
in
the
situation
calculus
event
calculus
and
action
languages
Here
is
a
simplified
example
which
illustrates
the
main
features
of
such
formalisms
The
first
clause
states
that
a
fact
holds
immediately
after
an
event
initiates
or
causes
the
fact
The
second
clause
is
a
frame
axiom
which
states
that
a
fact
that
holds
at
a
time
continues
to
hold
at
the
next
time
unless
it
is
terminated
by
an
event
that
happens
at
the
time
This
formulation
allows
more
than
one
event
to
occur
at
the
same
time
holds(Fact

2
happens(Event

happens(Event
Time
terminates(Event
Fact
Here
holds
is
a
meta-predicate
similar
to
solve
above
However
whereas
solve
has
only
one
argument
which
applies
to
general
clauses
the
first
argument
of
holds
is
a
fact
and
the
second
argument
is
a
time
or
state
The
atomic
formula
holds(Fact
Time
expresses
that
the
Fact
holds
at
the
Time
Such
time-varying
facts
are
also
called
fluents
The
atomic
formula
happens(Event
Time
expresses
that
the
Event
happens
at
the
Time
The
following
example
illustrates
how
these
clauses
can
be
used
to
reason
about
causality
in
a
toy
blocks
world
Here
in
the
initial
state
at
time
0
a
green
block
is
on
a
table
and
a
red
block
is
stacked
on
the
green
block
like
a
traffic
light
At
time
0
the
red
block
is
moved
to
the
table
At
time
1
the
green
block
is
moved
onto
the
red
block
Moving
an
object
onto
a
place
terminates
the
fact
that
the
object
is
on
any
place
and
initiates
the
fact
that
the
object
is
on
the
place
to
which
it
is
moved

Forward
reasoning
and
backward

the

to

But
forward
reasoning
generates

temporal
order
and
backward
reasoning
generates
fluents
regressively

the

use

47
Logic
programming
has
also
proved
to
be
useful
for
representing
domain-specific
expertise
in
expert
systems
48
But
human
expertise
like
general-purpose
commonsense
is
mostly
implicit
and
tacit
and
it
is
often
difficult
to
represent
such
implicit
knowledge
in
explicit
rules
This
difficulty
does
not
arise
however
when
logic
programs
are
used
to
represent
the
existing
explicit
rules
of
a
business
organisation
or
legal
authority
For
example
here
is
a
representation
of
a
simplified
version
of
the
first
sentence
of
the
British
Nationality
Act
which
states
that
a
person
who
is
born
in
the
UK
becomes
a
British
citizen
at
the
time
of
birth
if
a
parent
of
the

is

Historically
the
representation
of
a
large
portion
of
the
British
Nationality
Act
as
a
logic
program
in
the
1980
s
49
was
hugely
influential
for
the
development
of
computational
representations
of
legislation
showing
how
logic
programming
enables
intuitively
appealing

that
can
be

More

Main

Prolog
The
SLD
resolution
rule
of
inference
is
neutral
about
the
order
in
which
subgoals
in
the
bodies
of
clauses
can
be
selected
for
solution
For
the
sake
of
efficiency
Prolog
restricts
this
order
to
the
order
in
which
the
subgoals
are
written
SLD
is
also
neutral
about
the
strategy
for
searching
the
space
of
SLD
proofs
Prolog
searches
this
space
top-down
depth-first
trying
different
clauses
for
solving
the
same
sub)goal
in
the
order
in
which
the
clauses
are
written
This
search
strategy
has
the
advantage
that
the
current
branch
of
the
tree
can
be
represented
efficiently
by
a
stack
When
a
goal
clause
at
the
top
of
the
stack
is
reduced
to
a
new
goal
clause
the
new
goal
clause
is
pushed
onto
the
top
of
the
stack
When
the
selected
subgoal
in
the
goal
clause
at
the
top
of
the
stack
cannot
be
solved
the
search
strategy
backtracks
removing
the
goal
clause
from
the
top
of
the
stack
and
retrying
the
attempted
solution
of
the
selected
subgoal
in
the
previous
goal
clause
using
the
next
clause
that
matches
the
selected
subgoal
Backtracking
can
be
restricted
by
using
a
subgoal
called
cut
written
as
which
always
succeeds
but
cannot
be
backtracked
Cut
can
be
used
to
improve
efficiency
but
can
also
interfere
with
the
logical
meaning
of
clauses
In
many
cases
the
use
of
cut
can
be
replaced
by
negation
as
failure
In
fact
negation
as
failure
can
be
defined
in
Prolog
by
using
cut
together
with
any
literal
say
fail
that
unifies
with
the
head
of
no
clause
not(P
P
fail
not(P
Prolog
provides
other
features
in
addition
to
cut
that
do
not
have
a
logical
interpretation
These
include
the
built-in
predicates
assert
and
retract
for
destructively
updating
the
state
of
the
program
during
program
execution
For
example
the
toy
blocks
world
example
above
can
be
implemented
without
frame
axioms
using
destructive
change
of
state
on(green_block
table
on(red_block
green_block
move(Object
Place
2
retract(on(Object
Place
1
assert(on(Object

The
sequence
of
move
events
and
the
resulting
locations
of
the
blocks
can
be
computed
by
executing
the
query
move(red_block
table
move(green_block
red_block
on(Object
Place
Object
red_block
Place

Various
extensions
of
logic

have
been
developed
to
provide
a
logical
framework
for
such
destructive
change
of
state

Datalog

Main

Datalog
Datalog
is
a
database
definition
language
which
combines
a
relational
view
of
data
as
in
relational
databases
with
a
logical
view
as
in
logic
programming
Relational
databases
use
a
relational
calculus
or
relational
algebra
with
relational
operations
such
as
union
intersection
set
difference
and
cartesian
product
to
specify
queries
which
access
a
database
Datalog
uses
logical
connectives
such
as
or
and
and
not
in
the
bodies
of
rules
to
define
relations
as
part
of
the
database
itself
It
was
recognized
early
in
the
development
of
relational
databases
that
recursive
queries
cannot
be
expressed
in
either
relational
algebra
or
relational
calculus
and
that
this
defficiency
can
be
remedied
by
introducing
a
least-fixed-point
operator
56
57
In
contrast
recursive
relations
can
be
defined
naturally
by
rules
in
logic
programs
without
the
need
for
any
new
logical
connectives
or
operators
Datalog
differs
from
more
general
logic
programming
by
having
only
constants
and
variables
as
terms
Moreover
all
facts
are
variable-free
and
rules
are
restricted
so
that
if
they
are
executed
bottom-up
then
the
derived
facts
are
also
variable-free
For
example
consider
the
family
database
mother_child(elizabeth
charles
father_child(charles
william
father_child(charles
harry
parent_child(X
Y
mother_child(X
Y
parent_child(X
Y
father_child(X
Y
ancestor_descendant(X
Y
parent_child(X
X
ancestor_descendant(X
Y
ancestor_descendant(X
Z
ancestor_descendant(Z
Y
Bottom-up
execution
derives
the
following
set
of
additional
facts
and
terminates
parent_child(elizabeth
charles
parent_child(charles
william
parent_child(charles
harry
ancestor_descendant(elizabeth
charles
ancestor_descendant(charles
william
ancestor_descendant(charles
harry
ancestor_descendant(elizabeth
william
ancestor_descendant(elizabeth
harry
Top-down
execution
derives
the
same
answers
to
the
query
ancestor_descendant(X
Y
But
then
it
goes
into
an
infinite
loop
However
top-down
execution
with

Programming
Like

Answer
Set
programming
ASP
is
not
Turing-complete
Moreover
instead
of
separating
goals
or
queries
from
the
program
to
be
used
in
solving
the
goals
ASP
treats
the
whole
program
as
a
goal
and
solves
the
goal
by
generating
a
stable
model
that
makes
the
goal
true
For
this
purpose
it
uses
the
stable
model
semantics
according
to
which
a
logic
program
can
have
zero
one
or
more
intended
models
For
example
the
following
program
represents
a
degenerate
variant
of
the
map
colouring
problem
of
colouring
two
countries
red
or
green
country(oz
country(iz
adjacent(oz
iz
colour(C
red
country(C
not(colour(C
green
colour(C
green
country(C
not(colour(C

The
problem
has
four
solutions
represented
by
four
stable
models
country(oz
country(iz
adjacent(oz
iz
colour(oz
red
colour(iz
red
country(oz
country(iz
adjacent(oz
iz
colour(oz
green
colour(iz

country(oz
country(iz
adjacent(oz
iz
colour(oz
red
colour(iz
green
country(oz
country(iz
adjacent(oz
iz
colour(oz
green
colour(iz
red
To
represent
the
standard
version
of
the
map
colouring
problem
we
need
to
add
a
constraint
that
two
adjacent
countries
cannot
be
coloured
the
same
colour
In
ASP
this
constraint
can
be
written
as
a
clause
of
the
form
country(C
1
country(C
2
adjacent(C
1
C
2
colour(C
1
X
colour(C
2
X
With
the
addition
of
this
constraint
the
problem
now
has
only
two
solutions
country(oz
country(iz
adjacent(oz
iz
colour(oz
red
colour(iz
green
country(oz
country(iz
adjacent(oz
iz
colour(oz
green
colour(iz
red
The
addition
of
constraints
of
the
form
Body
eliminates
models
in
which
Body
is
true
Confusingly
constraints
in
ASP
are
different
from
constraints
in
CLP
Constraints
in
CLP
are
predicates
that
qualify
answers
to
queries
and
solutions
of
goals
Constraints
in
ASP
are
clauses
that
eliminate
models
that
would
otherwise
satisfy
goals
Constraints
in
ASP
are
like
integrity
constraints
in
databases
This
combination
of
ordinary
logic
programming
clauses
and
constraint
clauses
illustrates
the
generate-and-test
methodology
of
problem
solving
in
ASP
The
ordinary
clauses
define
a
search
space
of
possible
solutions
and
the
constraints
filter
out
unwanted
solutions
58
Most
implementations
of
ASP
proceed
in
two
steps
First
they
instantiate
the
program
in
all
possible
ways
reducing
it
to
a
propositional
logic
program
known
as
grounding
Then
they
apply
a
propositional
logic
problem
solver
such
as
the
DPLL
algorithm
or
a
Boolean
SAT
solver
However
some
implementations
such
as
s(CASP
59
use
a
goal-directed
top-down
SLD
resolution-like
procedure
without
grounding

ALP
like
CLP
extends
normal
logic
programming
by
allowing
the
bodies
of
clauses
to
contain
literals
whose
predicates
are
not
defined
by
clauses
In
ALP
these
predicates
are
declared
as
abducible
or
assumable
and
are
used
as
in
abductive
reasoning
to
explain
observations
or
more
generally
to
add
new
facts
to
the
program
as
assumptions
to
solve
goals
For
example
suppose
we
are
given
an
initial
state
in
which
a
red
block
is
on
a
green
block
on
a
table
at
time
0
holds(on(green_block

green_block
0
Suppose
we
are
also
given
the
goal
holds(on(green_block,red_block
3
holds(on(red_block,table
3
The
goal
can
represent
an
observation
in
which
case
a
solution
is
an
explanation
of
the
observation
Or
the
goal
can
represent
a
desired
future
state
of
affairs
in
which
case
a
solution
is
a
plan
for
achieving
the
goal
61
We
can
use
the
rules

presented
earlier
to
solve
the

by
treating
the

as

solves
the
goal
by
reasoning
backwards
and
adding
assumptions
to
the

to
solve
abducible

In
this
case
there
are
many
alternative
solutions
including
happens(move(red_block

Here
tick
is
an
event
that
marks
the

There
are
also
solutions
in
which
the

For
example
happens(move(red_block

Such

if

Inductive
logic
programming
ILP
is
an
approach
to
machine
learning
that
induces
logic
programs
as
hypothetical
generalisations
of
positive
and
negative
examples
Given
a
logic
program
representing
background
knowledge
and
positive
examples
together
with
constraints
representing
negative
examples
an
ILP
system
induces
a
logic
program
that
generalises
the
positive
examples
while
excluding
the
negative
examples
ILP
is
similar
to
ALP
in
that
both
can
be
viewed
as
generating
hypotheses
to
explain
observations
and
as
employing
constraints
to
exclude
undesirable
hypotheses
But
in
ALP
the
hypotheses
are
variable-free
facts
and
in
ILP
the
hypotheses
are
general
rules
63
64
For
example
given
only
background
knowledge
of
the
mother_child
and
father_child
relations
and
suitable
examples
of
the
grandparent_child
relation
current
ILP
systems
can
generate
the
definition
of
grandparent_child
inventing
an
auxiliary
predicate
which
can
be
interpreted
as
the
parent_child
relation
65
grandparent_child(X

auxiliary(X

Recent

Concurrent

edit
Main
article
Concurrent
logic
programming
Concurrent
logic
programming
integrates
concepts
of
logic
programming
with
concurrent
programming
Its
development
was
given
a
big
impetus
in
the
1980
s
by
its
choice
for
the
systems
programming
language
of
the
Japanese
Fifth
Generation
Project
FGCS
67
A
concurrent
logic
program
is
a
set
of
guarded
Horn
clauses
of
the
form
H
G
1
G[n
B
1
B[n
The
conjunction
G
1
G[n
is
called
the
guard
of
the
clause
and
is
the
commitment
operator
Declaratively
guarded
Horn
clauses
are
read
as
ordinary
logical
implications
H
if
G
1
and
and
G[n
and
B
1
and
and
B[n
However
procedurally
when
there
are
several
clauses
whose
heads
H
match
a
given
goal
then
all
of
the
clauses
are
executed
in
parallel
checking
whether
their
guards
G
1
G[n
hold
If
the
guards
of
more
than
one
clause
hold
then
a
committed
choice
is
made
to
one
of
the
clauses
and
execution
proceeds
with
the
subgoals
B
1
B[n
of
the
chosen
clause
These
subgoals
can
also
be
executed
in
parallel
Thus
concurrent
logic
programming
implements
a
form
of
don't
care
nondeterminism
rather
than
don't
know
nondeterminism
For
example
the
following
concurrent
logic
program
defines
a
predicate
shuffle(Left
Right
Merge
which
can
be
used
to
shuffle
two
lists
Left
and
Right
combining
them
into
a
single
list
Merge
that
preserves
the
ordering
of
the
two
lists
Left
and
Right
shuffle
shuffle(Left
Right
Merge
Left
First
Rest
Merge
First
ShortMerge
shuffle(Rest
Right
ShortMerge
shuffle(Left
Right
Merge
Right
First
Rest
Merge
First
ShortMerge
shuffle(Left
Rest
ShortMerge
Here
represents
the
empty
list
and
Head
Tail
represents
a
list
with
first
element
Head
followed
by
list
Tail
as
in
Prolog
Notice
that
the
first
occurrence
of
in
the
second
and
third
clauses
is
the
list
constructor
whereas
the
second
occurrence
of
is
the
commitment
operator
The
program
can
be
used
for
example
to
shuffle
the
lists
ace
queen
king
and
1
4
2
by
invoking
the
goal
clause
shuffle
ace
queen
king
1
4
2
Merge
The
program
will
non-deterministically
generate
a
single
solution
for
example
Merge
ace
queen
1
king

Carl
Hewitt
has
argued
68
that
because
of
the
indeterminacy
of
concurrent
computation
concurrent
logic
programming
cannot
implement
general
concurrency
However
according
to
the
logical
semantics
any
result
of
a
computation
of
a
concurrent
logic
program
is
a
logical
consequence
of
the
program
even
though
not
all
logical
consequences
can
be
derived
Concurrent

Concurrent
constraint

Concurrent
constraint
logic
programming
69
combines
concurrent
logic
programming
and
constraint
logic
programming
using
constraints
to
control
concurrency
A
clause
can
contain
a
guard
which
is
a
set
of
constraints
that
may
block
the
applicability
of
the
clause
When
the
guards
of
several
clauses
are
satisfied
concurrent
constraint
logic
programming
makes
a
committed
choice
to
use
only
one
Higher-order
logic
programming
edit
Several
researchers
have
extended
logic
programming
with
higher-order
programming
features
derived
from
higher-order
logic
such
as
predicate
variables
Such
languages
include
the
Prolog
extensions
HiLog
70
and
λProlog
71
Linear
logic
programming
edit
Basing
logic
programming
within
linear
logic
has
resulted
in
the
design
of
logic
programming
languages
that
are
considerably
more
expressive
than
those
based
on
classical
logic
Horn
clause
programs
can
only
represent
state
change
by
the
change
in
arguments
to
predicates
In
linear
logic
programming
one
can
use
the
ambient
linear
logic
to
support
state
change
Some
early
designs
of
logic
programming
languages
based
on
linear
logic
include
LO
72
Lolli
73
ACL
74
and
Forum
75

Logtalk

with
support
for

protocols
and
other
OOP
concepts
It
supports
most
standard-compliant
Prolog
systems

Transaction
logic
programming
edit
Transaction
logic
53
is
an
extension
of
logic
programming
with
a
logical
theory
of
state-modifying
updates
It
has
both
a
model-theoretic
semantics
and
a
procedural
one
An
implementation
of
a

In
a
computer
most
of
the
electronic
circuits
are
made
up
logic
gates
Logic
gates
are
used
to
create
a
circuit
that
performs
calculations
data
storage
or
shows
off
object-oriented
programming
especially
the
power
of
inheritance
Logic
gates
can
also
be
constructed
using
vacuum
tubes
electromagnetic
elements
like
optics
molecule
etc
What
is
Logic
Gate
A
Logic
gate
is
an
elementary
building
block
of
any
digital
circuits
It
takes
one
or
two
inputs
and
produces
output
based
on
those
inputs
Outputs
may
be
high
1
or
low
0
Logic
gates
are
implemented
using
diodes
or
transistors
There
are
seven
basic
logic
gates
defined
these
are
1

Below
are
the
brief
details
about
them
along
with
their
implementation

no
more
than
two
logic

Logical
reasoning
is
concerned
with
the
correctness
of
arguments
A
key
distinction
is
between
deductive
and
non-deductive
arguments
Logical
reasoning
is
a
mental
activity
that
aims
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion
in
a
rigorous
way
It
happens
in
the
form
of
inferences
or
arguments
by
starting
from
a
set
of
premises
and
reasoning
to
a
conclusion
supported
by
these
premises
The
premises
and
the
conclusion
are
propositions
i.e
true
or
false
claims
about
what
is
the
case
Together
they
form
an
argument
Logical
reasoning
is
norm-governed
in
the
sense
that
it
aims
to
formulate
correct
arguments
that
any
rational
person
would
find
convincing
The
main
discipline
studying
logical
reasoning
is
logic
Distinct
types
of
logical
reasoning
differ
from
each
other
concerning
the
norms
they
employ
and
the
certainty
of
the
conclusion
they
arrive
at
Deductive
reasoning
offers
the
strongest
support
the
premises
ensure
the
conclusion
meaning
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
conclusion
to
be
false
if
all
the
premises
are
true
Such
an
argument
is
called
a
valid
argument
for
example
all
men
are
mortal
Socrates
is
a
man
therefore
Socrates
is
mortal
For
valid
arguments
it
is
not
important
whether
the
premises
are
actually
true
but
only
that
if
they
were
true
the
conclusion
could
not
be
false
Valid
arguments
follow
a
rule
of
inference
such
as
modus
ponens
or
modus
tollens
Deductive
reasoning
plays
a
central
role
in
formal
logic
and
mathematics
For
non-deductive
logical
reasoning
the
premises
make
their
conclusion
rationally
convincing
without
ensuring
its
truth
This
is
often
understood
in
terms
of
probability
the
premises
make
it
more
likely
that
the
conclusion
is
true
and
strong
inferences
make
it
very
likely
Some
uncertainty
remains
because
the
conclusion
introduces
new
information
not
already
found
in
the
premises
Non-deductive
reasoning
plays
a
central
role
in
everyday
life
and
in
most
sciences
Often-discussed
types
are
inductive
abductive
and
analogical
reasoning
Inductive
reasoning
is
a
form
of
generalization
that
infers
a
universal
law
from
a
pattern
found
in
many
individual
cases
It
can
be
used
to
conclude
that
all
ravens
are
black
based
on
many
individual
observations
of
black
ravens
Abductive
reasoning
also
known
as
inference
to
the
best
explanation
starts
from
an
observation
and
reasons
to
the
fact
explaining
this
observation
An
example
is
a
doctor
who
examines
the
symptoms
of
their
patient
to
make
a
diagnosis
of
the
underlying
cause
Analogical
reasoning
compares
two
similar
systems
It
observes
that
one
of
them
has
a
feature
and
concludes
that
the
other
one
also
has
this
feature
Arguments
that
fall
short
of
the
standards
of
logical
reasoning
are
called
fallacies
For
formal
fallacies
like
affirming
the
consequent
the
error
lies
in
the
logical
form
of
the
argument
For
informal
fallacies
like
false
dilemmas
the
source
of
the
faulty
reasoning
is
usually
found
in
the
content
or
the
context
of
the
argument
Some
theorists
understand
logical
reasoning
in
a
wide
sense
that
is
roughly
equivalent
to
critical
thinking
In
this
regard
it
encompasses
cognitive
skills
besides
the
ability
to
draw
conclusions
from
premises
Examples
are
skills
to
generate
and
evaluate
reasons
and
to
assess
the
reliability
of
information
Further
factors
are
to
seek
new
information
to
avoid
inconsistencies
and
to
consider
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
different
courses
of
action
before
making
a
decision

Definition

Logical
reasoning
is
a
form
of
thinking
that
is
concerned
with
arriving
at
a
conclusion
in
a
rigorous
way
1
This
happens
in
the
form
of
inferences
by
transforming
the
information
present
in
a
set
of
premises
to
reach
a
conclusion
2
3
It
can
be
defined
as
selecting
and
interpreting
information
from
a
given
context
making
connections
and
verifying
and
drawing
conclusions
based
on
provided
and
interpreted
information
and
the
associated
rules
and
processes
4
Logical
reasoning
is
rigorous
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
generate
any
conclusion
but
ensures
that
the
premises
support
the
conclusion
and
act
as
reasons
for
believing
it
5
6
One
central
aspect
is
that
this
support
is
not
restricted
to
a
specific
reasoner
but
that
any
rational
person
would
find
the
conclusion
convincing
based
on
the
premises
6
1
This
way
logical
reasoning
plays
a
role
in
expanding
knowledge
7
The
main
discipline
studying
logical
reasoning
is
called
logic
It
is
divided
into
formal
and
informal
logic
which
study
formal
and
informal
logical
reasoning
8
9
10
Traditionally
logical
reasoning
was
primarily
associated
with
deductive
reasoning
studied
by
formal
logic
11
But
in
a
wider
sense
it
also
includes
forms
of
non-deductive
reasoning
such
as
inductive
abductive
and
analogical
reasoning
12
13
14
The
forms
of
logical
reasoning
have
in
common
that
they
use
premises
to
make
inferences
in
a
norm-governed
way
As
norm-governed
practices
they
aim
at
inter-subjective
agreement
about
the
application
of
the
norms
i.e
agreement
about
whether
and
to
what
degree
the
premises
support
their
conclusion
The
types
of
logical
reasoning
differ
concerning
the
exact
norms
they
use
as
well
as
the
certainty
of
the
conclusion
they
arrive
at
1
15
Deductive
reasoning
offers
the
strongest
support
and
implies
its
conclusion
with
certainty
like
mathematical
proofs
For
non-deductive
reasoning
the
premises
make
the
conclusion
more
likely
but
do
not
ensure
it
This
support
comes
in
degrees
strong
arguments
make
the
conclusion
very
likely
as
is
the
case
for
well-researched
issues
in
the
empirical
sciences
1
16
Some
theorists
give
a
very
wide
definition
of
logical
reasoning
that
includes
its
role
as
a
cognitive
skill
responsible
for
high-quality
thinking
In
this
regard
it
has
roughly
the
same
meaning
as
critical
thinking
13
17
Basic
concepts
edit
A
variety
of
basic
concepts
is
used
in
the
study
and
analysis
of
logical
reasoning
Logical
reasoning
happens
by
inferring
a
conclusion
from
a
set
of
premises
3
Premises
and
conclusions
are
normally
seen
as
propositions
A
proposition
is
a
statement
that
makes
a
claim
about
what
is
the
case
In
this
regard
propositions
act
as
truth-bearers
they
are
either
true
or
false
18
19
3
For
example
the
sentence
The
water
is
boiling
expresses
a
proposition
since
it
can
be
true
or
false
The
sentences
Is
the
water
boiling
or
Boil
the
water
on
the
other
hand
express
no
propositions
since
they
are
neither
true
nor
false
20
3
The
propositions
used
as
the
starting
point
of
logical
reasoning
are
called
the
premises
The
proposition
inferred
from
them
is
called
the
conclusion
18
19
For
example
in
the
argument
all
puppies
are
dogs
all
dogs
are
animals
therefore
all
puppies
are
animals
the
propositions
all
puppies
are
dogs
and
all
dogs
are
animals
act
as
premises
while
the
proposition
all
puppies
are
animals
is
the
conclusion
21
22
A
set
of
premises
together
with
a
conclusion
is
called
an
argument
23
3
An
inference
is
the
mental
process
of
reasoning
that
starts
from
the
premises
and
arrives
at
the
conclusion
18
24
But
the
terms
argument
and
inference
are
often
used
interchangeably
in
logic
The
purpose
of
arguments
is
to
convince
a
person
that
something
is
the
case
by
providing
reasons
for
this
belief
25
26
Many
arguments
in
natural
language
do
not
explicitly
state
all
the
premises
Instead
the
premises
are
often
implicitly
assumed
especially
if
they
seem
obvious
and
belong
to
common
sense
25
27
Some
theorists
distinguish
between
simple
and
complex
arguments
A
complex
argument
is
made
up
of
many
sub-arguments
This
way
a
chain
is
formed
in
which
the
conclusions
of
earlier
arguments
act
as
premises
for
later
arguments
Each
link
in
this
chain
has
to
be
successful
for
a
complex
argument
to
succeed
18
25
An
argument
is
correct
or
incorrect
depending
on
whether
the
premises
offer
support
for
the
conclusion
This
is
often
understood
in
terms
of
probability
if
the
premises
of
a
correct
argument
are
true
it
raises
the
probability
that
its
conclusion
is
also
true
Forms
of
logical
reasoning
can
be
distinguished
based
on
how
the
premises
support
the
conclusion
Deductive
arguments
offer
the
strongest
possible
support
Non-deductive
arguments
are
weaker
but
are
nonetheless
correct
forms
of
reasoning
28
29
The
term
proof
is
often
used
for
deductive
arguments
or
very
strong
non-deductive
arguments
30
Incorrect
arguments
offer
no
or
not
sufficient
support
and
are
called
fallacies
31
32
although
the
use
of
incorrect
arguments
does
not
mean
their
conclusions
are
incorrect
33
Deductive
reasoning
edit
Main
article
Deductive
reasoning
Deductive
reasoning
is
the
mental
process
of
drawing
deductive
inferences
Deductively
valid
inferences
are
the
most
reliable
form
of
inference
it
is
impossible
for
their
conclusion
to
be
false
if
all
the
premises
are
true
34
35
This
means
that
the
truth
of
the
premises
ensures
the
truth
of
the
conclusion
A
deductive
argument
is
sound
if
it
is
valid
and
all
its
premises
are
true
36
For
example
inferring
the
conclusion
no
cats
are
frogs
from
the
premises
all
frogs
are
amphibians
and
no
cats
are
amphibians
is
a
sound
argument
But
even
arguments
with
false
premises
can
be
deductively
valid
like
inferring
that
no
cats
are
frogs
from
the
premises
all
frogs
are
mammals
and
no
cats
are
mammals
In
this
regard
it
only
matters
that
the
conclusion
could
not
be
false
if
the
premises
are
true
and
not
whether
they
actually
are
true
37
Deductively
valid
arguments
follow
a
rule
of
inference
38
A
rule
of
inference
is
a
scheme
of
drawing
conclusions
that
depends
only
on
the
logical
form
of
the
premises
and
the
conclusion
but
not
on
their
specific
content
39
40
The
most-discussed
rule
of
inference
is
the
modus
ponens
It
has
the
following
form
p
if
p
then
q
therefore
q
This
scheme
is
deductively
valid
no
matter
what
p
and
q
stand
for
41
5
For
example
the
argument
today
is
Sunday
if
today
is
Sunday
then
I
don't
have
to
go
to
work
today
therefore
I
don't
have
to
go
to
work
today
is
deductively
valid
because
it
has
the
form
of
modus
ponens
42
Other
popular
rules
of
inference
include
modus
tollens
not
q
if
p
then
q
therefore
not
p
and
the
disjunctive
syllogism
p
or
q
not
p
therefore
q
42
43
The
rules
governing
deductive
reasoning
are
often
expressed
formally
as
logical
systems
for
assessing
the
correctness
of
deductive
arguments
Aristotelian
logic
is
one
of
the
earliest
systems
and
was
treated
as
the
canon
of
logic
in
the
Western
world
for
over
two
thousand
years
It
is
based
on
syllogisms
like
concluding
that
Socrates
is
a
mortal
from
the
premises
Socrates
is
a
man
and
all
men
are
mortal
44
45
46
The
currently
dominant
system
is
known
as
classical
logic
and
covers
many
additional
forms
of
inferences
besides
syllogisms
So-called
extended
logics
are
based
on
classical
logic
and
introduce
additional
rules
of
inference
for
specific
domains
For
example
modal
logic
can
be
used
to
reason
about
what
is
possible
and
what
is
necessary
Temporal
logic
can
be
used
to
draw
inferences
about
what
happened
before
during
and
after
an
event
47
48
49
Classical
logic
and
its
extensions
rest
on
a
set
of
basic
logical
intuitions
accepted
by
most
logicians
They
include
the
law
of
excluded
middle
the
double
negation
elimination
the
principle
of
explosion
and
the
bivalence
of
truth
50
So-called
deviant
logics
reject
some
of
these
basic
intuitions
and
propose
alternative
rules
governing
the
validity
of
arguments
44
51
52
For
example
intuitionistic
logics
reject
the
law
of
excluded
middle
and
the
double
negation
elimination
while
paraconsistent
logics
reject
the
principle
of
explosion
52
53
54
Deductive
reasoning
plays
a
central
role
in
formal
logic
and
mathematics
1
In
mathematics
it
is
used
to
prove
mathematical
theorems
based
on
a
set
of
premises
usually
called
axioms
For
example
Peano
arithmetic
is
based
on
a
small
set
of
axioms
from
which
all
essential
properties
of
natural
numbers
can
be
inferred
using
deductive
reasoning
55
56
Non-deductive
reasoning
edit
Non-deductive
reasoning
is
an
important
form
of
logical
reasoning
besides
deductive
reasoning
It
happens
in
the
form
of
inferences
drawn
from
premises
to
reach
and
support
a
conclusion
just
like
its
deductive
counterpart
The
hallmark
of
non-deductive
reasoning
is
that
this
support
is
fallible
This
means
that
if
the
premises
are
true
it
makes
it
more
likely
but
not
certain
that
the
conclusion
is
also
true
57
58
So
for
a
non-deductive
argument
it
is
possible
for
all
its
premises
to
be
true
while
its
conclusion
is
still
false
There
are
various
types
of
non-deductive
reasoning
like
inductive
abductive
and
analogical
reasoning
1
59
Non-deductive
reasoning
is
more
common
in
everyday
life
than
deductive
reasoning
60
Non-deductive
reasoning
is
ampliative
and
defeasible
61
62
Sometimes
the
terms
non-deductive
reasoning
ampliative
reasoning
and
defeasible
reasoning
are
used
synonymously
even
though
there
are
slight
differences
in
their
meaning
Non-deductive
reasoning
is
ampliative
in
the
sense
that
it
arrives
at
information
not
already
present
in
the
premises
Deductive
reasoning
by
contrast
is
non-ampliative
since
it
only
extracts
information
already
present
in
the
premises
without
adding
any
additional
information
62
63
59
So
with
non-deductive
reasoning
one
can
learn
something
new
that
one
did
not
know
before
But
the
fact
that
new
information
is
added
means
that
this
additional
information
may
be
false
This
is
why
non-deductive
reasoning
is
not
as
secure
as
deductive
reasoning
58
64
A
closely
related
aspect
is
that
non-deductive
reasoning
is
defeasible
or
non-monotonic
This
means
that
one
may
have
to
withdraw
a
conclusion
upon
learning
new
information
For
example
if
all
birds
a
person
has
seen
so
far
can
fly
this
person
is
justified
in
reaching
the
inductive
conclusion
that
all
birds
fly
This
conclusion
is
defeasible
because
the
reasoner
may
have
to
revise
it
upon
learning
that
penguins
are
birds
that
do
not
fly

Inductive
reasoning
Photo
of
an
Australian
raven
Based
on
many
individual
observations
of
black
ravens
inductive
reasoning
can
be
used
to
infer
that
all
ravens
are
black
Inductive
reasoning
starts
from
a
set
of
individual
instances
and
uses
generalization
to
arrive
at
a
universal
law
governing
all
cases
68
69
70
Some
theorists
use
the
term
in
a
very
wide
sense
to
include
any
form
of
non-deductive
reasoning
even
if
no
generalization
is
involved
69
71
68
In
the
more
narrow
sense
it
can
be
defined
as
the
process
of
inferring
a
general
law
or
principle
from
the
observations
of
particular
instances
68
For
example
starting
from
the
empirical
observation
that
all
ravens
I
have
seen
so
far
are
black
inductive
reasoning
can
be
used
to
infer
that
all
ravens
are
black
In
a
slightly
weaker
form
induction
can
also
be
used
to
infer
an
individual
conclusion
about
a
single
case
for
example
that
the
next
raven
I
will
see
is
black
69
1
Inductive
reasoning
is
closely
related
to
statistical
reasoning
and
probabilistic
reasoning
72
Like
other
forms
of
non-deductive
reasoning
induction
is
not
certain
This
means
that
the
premises
support
the
conclusion
by
making
it
more
probable
but
do
not
ensure
its
truth
In
this
regard
the
conclusion
of
an
inductive
inference
contains
new
information
not
already
found
in
the
premises
68
60
1
Various
aspects
of
the
premises
are
important
to
ensure
that
they
offer
significant
support
to
the
conclusion
In
this
regard
the
sample
size
should
be
large
to
guarantee
that
many
individual
cases
were
considered
before
drawing
the
conclusion
60
73
An
intimately
connected
factor
is
that
the
sample
is
random
and
representative
This
means
that
it
includes
a
fair
and
balanced
selection
of
individuals
with
different
key
characteristics
For
example
when
making
a
generalization
about
human
beings
the
sample
should
include
members
of
different
races
genders
and
age
groups
60
74
75
A
lot
of
reasoning
in
everyday
life
is
inductive
For
example
when
predicting
how
a
person
will
react
to
a
situation
inductive
reasoning
can
be
employed
based
on
how
the
person
reacted
previously
in
similar
circumstances
It
plays
an
equally
central
role
in
the
sciences
which
often
start
with
many
particular
observations
and
then
apply
the
process
of
generalization
to
arrive
at
a
universal
law
76
77
1
A
well-known
issue
in
the
field
of
inductive
reasoning
is
the
so-called
problem
of
induction
It
concerns
the
question
of
whether
or
why
anyone
is
justified
in
believing
the
conclusions
of
inductive
inferences
This
problem
was
initially
raised
by
David
Hume
who
holds
that
future
events
need
not
resemble
past
observations
In
this
regard
inductive
reasoning
about
future
events
seems
to
rest
on
the
assumption
that
nature
remains
uniform
78
79
Abductive
edit
Main
article
Abductive
reasoning
Abductive
reasoning
is
usually
understood
as
an
inference
from
an
observation
to
a
fact
explaining
this
observation
Inferring
that
it
has
rained
after
seeing
that
the
streets
are
wet
is
one
example
Often
the
expression
inference
to
the
best
explanation
is
used
as
a
synonym
80
81
1
This
expression
underlines
that
there
are
usually
many
possible
explanations
of
the
same
fact
and
that
the
reasoner
should
only
infer
the
best
explanation
For
example
a
tsunami
could
also
explain
why
the
streets
are
wet
but
this
is
usually
not
the
best
explanation
As
a
form
of
non-deductive
reasoning
abduction
does
not
guarantee
the
truth
of
the
conclusion
even
if
the
premises
are
true
80
82
The
more
plausible
the
explanation
is
the
stronger
it
is
supported
by
the
premises
In
this
regard
it
matters
that
the
explanation
is
simple
i.e
does
not
include
any
unnecessary
claims
and
that
it
is
consistent
with
established
knowledge
83
81
84
Other
central
criteria
for
a
good
explanation
are
that
it
fits
observed
and
commonly
known
facts
and
that
it
is
relevant
precise
and
not
circular
Ideally
the
explanation
should
be
verifiable
by
empirical
evidence
If
the
explanation
involves
extraordinary
claims
then
it
requires
very
strong
evidence
84
Photo
of
a
medical
examination
Doctors
use
abductive
reasoning
when
investigating
the
symptoms
of
a
patient
to
determine
their
underlying
cause
Abductive
reasoning
plays
a
central
role
in
science
when
researchers
discover
unexplained
phenomena
In
this
case
they
often
resort
to
a
form
of
guessing
to
come
up
with
general
principles
that
could
explain
the
observations
The
hypotheses
are
then
tested
and
compared
to
discover
which
one
provides
the
best
explanation
85
84
This
pertains
particularly
to
cases
of
causal
reasoning
that
try
to
discover
the
relation
between
causes
and
effects
84
Abduction
is
also
very
common
in
everyday
life
It
is
used
there
in
a
similar
but
less
systematic
form
85
84
This
relates
for
example
to
the
trust
people
put
in
what
other
people
say
The
best
explanation
of
why
a
person
asserts
a
claim
is
usually
that
they
believe
it
and
have
evidence
for
it
This
form
of
abductive
reasoning
is
relevant
to
why
one
normally
trusts
what
other
people
say
even
though
this
inference
is
usually
not
drawn
in
an
explicit
way
Something
similar
happens
when
the
speaker's
statement
is
ambiguous
and
the
audience
tries
to
discover
and
explain
what
the
speaker
could
have
meant
85
Abductive
reasoning
is
also
common
in
medicine
when
a
doctor
examines
the
symptoms
of
their
patient
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
diagnosis
of
their
underlying
cause

Analogical
edit
Photo

a
Zucker
rat
Analogical
reasoning
can
be
used
to
transfer
insights
from
animal
experiments
to
humans
like
in
the
case
of
research
on
obesity
and
hypertension
performed
on
Zucker
rats
86
87
Analogical
reasoning
involves
the
comparison
of
two
systems
in
relation
to
their
similarity
It
starts
from
information
about
one
system
and
infers
information
about
another
system
based
on
the
resemblance
between
the
two
systems
88
89
Expressed
schematically
arguments
from
analogy
have
the
following
form
1
a
is
similar
to
b
2
a
has
feature
F
3
therefore
b
probably
also
has
feature
F
89
90
Analogical
reasoning
can
be
used
for
example
to
infer
information
about
humans
from
medical
experiments
on
animals
1
rats
are
similar
to
humans
2
birth
control
pills
affect
the
brain
development
of
rats
3
therefore
they
may
also
affect
the
brain
development
of
humans
86
Through
analogical
reasoning
knowledge
can
be
transferred
from
one
situation
or
domain
to
another
Arguments
from
analogy
provide
support
for
their
conclusion
but
do
not
guarantee
its
truth
Their
strength
depends
on
various
factors
The
more
similar
the
systems
are
the
more
likely
it
is
that
a
given
feature
of
one
object
also
characterizes
the
other
object
Another
factor
concerns
not
just
the
degree
of
similarity
but
also
its
relevance
For
example
an
artificial
strawberry
made
of
plastic
may
be
similar
to
a
real
strawberry
in
many
respects
including
its
shape
color
and
surface
structure
But
these
similarities
are
irrelevant
to
whether
the
artificial
strawberry
tastes
as
sweet
as
the
real
one
91
Analogical
reasoning
plays
a
central
role
in
problem-solving
decision-making
and
learning
It
can
be
used
both
for
simple
physical
characteristics
and
complex
abstract
ideas
92
93
In
science
analogies
are
often
used
in
models
to
understand
complex
phenomena
in
a
simple
way
For
example
the
Bohr
model
explains
the
interactions
of
sub-atomic
particles
in
analogy
to
how
planets
revolve
around
the
sun

Fallacies
edit
Main
article
Fallacy
A
fallacy
is
an
incorrect
argument
or
a
faulty
form
of
reasoning
This
means
that
the
premises
provide
no
or
not
sufficient
support
for
the
conclusion
Fallacies
often
appear
to
be
correct
on
the
first
impression
and
thereby
seduce
people
into
accepting
and
using
them
In
logic
the
term
fallacy
does
not
mean
that
the
conclusion
is
false
Instead
it
only
means
that
some
kind
of
error
was
committed
on
the
way
to
reaching
the
conclusion
An
argument
can
be
a
fallacy
even
if
by
a
fortuitous
accident
the
conclusion
is
true
Outside
the
field
of
logic
the
term
fallacy
is
sometimes
used
in
a
slightly
different
sense
for
a
false
belief
or
theory
and
not
for
an
argument
32
96
97
Fallacies
are
usually
divided
into
formal
and
informal
fallacies
Formal
fallacies
are
expressed
in
a
formal
language
and
usually
belong
to
deductive
reasoning
Their
fault
lies
in
the
logical
form
of
the
argument
i.e
that
it
does
not
follow
a
valid
rule
of
inference
98
99
A
well-known
formal
fallacy
is
affirming
the
consequent
It
has
the
following
form
1
q
2
if
p
then
q
3
therefore
p
This
fallacy
is
committed
for
example
when
a
person
argues
that
the
burglars
entered
by
the
front
door
based
on
the
premises
the
burglars
forced
the
lock
and
if
the
burglars
entered
by
the
front
door
then
they
forced
the
lock
100
This
fallacy
is
similar
to
the
valid
rule
of
inference
known
as
modus
ponens
It
is
faulty
because
the
first
premise
and
the
conclusion
are
switched
around
Other
well-known
formal
fallacies
are
denying
the
antecedent
affirming
a
disjunct
denying
a
conjunct
and
the
fallacy
of
the
undistributed
middle
32
96
101
Informal
fallacies
are
expressed
in
natural
language
Their
main
fault
usually
lies
not
in
the
form
of
the
argument
but
has
other
sources
like
its
content
or
context
96
99
Some
informal
fallacies
like
some
instances
of
false
dilemmas
and
strawman
fallacies
even
involve
correct
deductive
reasoning
on
the
formal
level
97
The
content
of
an
argument
is
the
idea
that
is
expressed
in
it
For
example
a
false
dilemma
is
an
informal
fallacy
that
is
based
on
an
error
in
one
of
the
premises
The
faulty
premise
oversimplifies
reality
it
states
that
things
are
either
one
way
or
another
way
but
ignore
many
other
viable
alternatives
102
103
False
dilemmas
are
often
used
by
politicians
when
they
claim
that
either
their
proposal
is
accepted
or
there
will
be
dire
consequences
Such
claims
usually
ignore
that
various
alternatives
exist
to
avoid
those
consequences
i.e
that
their
proposal
is
not
the
only
viable
solution
104
The
strawman
fallacy
is
another
informal
fallacy
Its
error
happens
on
the
level
of
the
context
It
consists
in
misrepresenting
the
view
of
an
opponent
and
then
refuting
this
view
The
refutation
itself
is
often
correct
but
the
error
lies
in
the
false
assumption
that
the
opponent
actually
defends
this
view
For
example
an
alcohol
lobbyist
may
respond
to
the
suggestion
to
ban
alcohol
advertisements
on
television
by
claiming
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
people
give
up
drinking
alcohol
This
is
a
strawman
fallacy
since
the
suggestion
was

Ambiguous
and
vague
expressions
in
natural
language
are
often
responsible
for
the
faulty
reasoning
in
informal
fallacies
For
example
this
is
the
case
for
fallacies
of
ambiguity
like
the
argument
1
feathers
are
light
2
light
is
opposed
to
darkness
3
therefore
feathers
are
opposed
to
darkness
The
error
is
found
in
the
ambiguous
term
light
which
has
one
meaning
in
the
first
premise
not
heavy
and
a
different
meaning
in
the
second
premise
visible
electromagnetic
radiation
107

As
a
skill
edit
Some
theorists
discuss
logical
reasoning
in
a
very
wide
sense
that
includes
its
role
as
a
broad
skill
responsible
for
high-quality
thinking
In
this
sense
it
is
roughly
equivalent
to
critical
thinking
and
includes
the
capacity
to
select
and
apply
the
appropriate
rules
of
logic
to
specific
situations
110
It
encompasses
a
great
variety
of
abilities
besides
drawing
conclusions
from
premises
Examples
are
to
understand
a
position
to
generate
and
evaluate
reasons
for
and
against
it
as
well
as
to
critically
assess
whether
to
accept
or
reject
certain
information
It
is
about
making
judgments
and
drawing
conclusions
after
careful
evaluation
and
contrasts
in
this
regard
with
uncritical
snap
judgments
and
gut
feelings
17
Other
core
skills
linked
to
logical
reasoning
are
to
assess
reasons
before
accepting
a
claim
and
to
search
for
new
information
if
more
is
needed
to
reach
a
reliable
conclusion
It
also
includes
the
ability
to
consider
different
courses
of
action
and
compare
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
their
consequences
to
use
common
sense
and
to
avoid
inconsistencies
111
112
The
skills
responsible
for
logical
reasoning
can
be
learned
trained
and
improved
17
113
Logical
reasoning
is
relevant
both
on
the
theoretical
and
practical
level
114
115
On
the
theoretical
level
it
helps
decrease
the
number
of
false
beliefs
A
central
aspect
concerns
the
abilities
used
to
distinguish
facts
from
mere
opinions
like
the
process
of
finding
and
evaluating
reasons
for
and
against
a
position
to
come
to
one's
own
conclusion
114
This
includes
being
able
to
differentiate
between
reliable
and
unreliable
sources
of
information
This
matters
for
effective
reasoning
since
it
is
often
necessary
to
rely
on
information
provided
by
other
people
instead
of
checking
every
single
fact
for
oneself
116
117
This
way
logical
reasoning
can
help
the
person
avoid
the
effects
of
propaganda
or
being
manipulated
by
others
118
119
When
important
information
is
missing
it
is
often
better
to
suspend
judgment
than
to
jump
to
conclusions
118
In
this
regard
logical
reasoning
should
be
skeptical
and
open-minded
at
the
same
time
120
On
the
practical
level
logical
reasoning
concerns
the
issue
of
making
rational
and
effective
decisions
114
115
For
many
real-life
decisions
various
courses
of
action
are
available
to
the
agent
For
each
possible
action
there
can
be
conflicting
reasons
some
in
favor
of
it
and
others
opposed
to
it
In
such
cases
logical
reasoning
includes
weighing
the
potential
benefits
and
drawbacks
as
well
as
considering
their
likelihood
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
balanced
all-things-considered
decision
121
122
For
example
when
a
person
runs
out
of
drinking
water
in
the
middle
of
a
hiking
trip
they
could
employ
the
skills
associated
with
logical
reasoning
to
decide
whether
to
boil
and
drink
water
from
a
stream
that
might
contain
dangerous
microorganisms
rather
than
break
off
the
trip
and
hike
back
to
the
parking
lot
This
could
include
considering
factors
like
assessing
how
dangerous
the
microorganisms
are
and
the
likelihood
that
they
survive
the
boiling
procedure
It
may
also
involve
gathering
relevant
information
to
make
these
assessments
for
example
by
asking
other
hikers
123
Time
also
plays
a
central
role
in
logical
reasoning
124
If
one
lacks
important
information
it
is
often
better
to
delay
a
decision
and
look
for
new
information
before
coming
to
a
conclusion
111
If
the
decision
is
time-sensitive
on
the
other
hand
logical
reasoning
may
imply
making
a
fast
decision
based
on
the
currently
available
evidence
even
if
it
is
very
limited
For
example
if
a
friend
yells
Duck
during
a
baseball
game
the
most
logical
response
may
be
to
blindly
trust
them
and
duck
instead
of
demanding
an
explanation
or
investigating
what
might
have
prompted
their
exclamation
124
125
Generally
speaking
the
less
time
there
is
the
more
significant
it
is
to
trust
intuitions
and
gut
feelings
If
there
is
more
time
on
the
other
hand
it
becomes
important
to
examine
ambiguities
and
assess
contradictory
information

Logical
consequence
also
entailment
or
implication
is
a
fundamental
concept
in
logic
which
describes
the
relationship
between
statements
that
hold
true
when
one
statement
logically
follows
from
one
or
more
statements
A
valid
logical
argument
is
one
in
which
the
conclusion
is
entailed
by
the
premises
because
the
conclusion
is
the
consequence
of
the
premises
The
philosophical
analysis
of
logical
consequence
involves
the
questions
In
what
sense
does
a
conclusion
follow
from
its
premises
and
What
does
it
mean
for
a
conclusion
to
be
a
consequence
of
premises
1
All
of
philosophical
logic
is
meant
to
provide
accounts
of
the
nature
of
logical
consequence
and
the
nature
of
logical
truth
2
Logical
consequence
is
necessary
and
formal
by
way
of
examples
that
explain
with
formal
proof
and
models
of
interpretation
1
A
sentence
is
said
to
be
a
logical
consequence
of
a
set
of
sentences
for
a
given
language
if
and
only
if
using
only
logic
i.e
without
regard
to
any
personal
interpretations
of
the
sentences
the
sentence
must
be
true
if
every
sentence
in
the
set
is
true

The
Polish
logician
Alfred
Tarski
identified
three
features
of
an
adequate
characterization
of
entailment
1
The
logical
consequence
relation
relies
on
the
logical
form
of
the
sentences
2
The
relation
is
a
priori
i.e
it
can
be
determined
with
or
without
regard
to
empirical
evidence
sense
experience
and
3
The
logical
consequence
relation
has
a
modal
component
3
Formal
accounts
edit
The
most
widely
prevailing
view
on
how
best
to
account
for
logical
consequence
is
to
appeal
to
formality
This
is
to
say
that
whether
statements
follow
from
one
another
logically
depends
on
the
structure
or
logical
form
of
the
statements
without
regard
to
the
contents
of
that
form
Syntactic
accounts
of
logical
consequence
rely
on
schemes
using
inference
rules
For
instance
we
can
express
the
logical
form
of
a
valid
argument
as
All
X
are
Y
All
Y
are
Z
Therefore
all
X
are
Z
This
argument
is
formally
valid
because
every
instance
of
arguments
constructed
using
this
scheme
is
valid
This
is
in
contrast
to
an
argument
like
Fred
is
Mike's
brother's
son
Therefore
Fred
is
Mike's
nephew
Since
this
argument
depends
on
the
meanings
of
the
words
brother
son
and
nephew
the
statement
Fred
is
Mike's
nephew
is
a
so-called
material
consequence
of
Fred
is
Mike's
brother's
son
not
a
formal
consequence
A
formal
consequence
must
be
true
in
all
cases
however
this
is
an
incomplete
definition
of
formal
consequence
since
even
the
argument
P
is
Q's
brother's
son
therefore
P
is
Q's
nephew
is
valid
in
all
cases
but
is
not
a
formal
argument

Deductively
valid
arguments
can
be
known
to
be
so
without
recourse
to
experience
so
they
must
be
knowable
a
priori
1
However
formality
alone
does
not
guarantee
that
logical
consequence
is
not
influenced
by
empirical
knowledge
So
the
a
priori
property
of
logical
consequence
is
considered
to
be
independent
of
formality

Proofs
and
models
edit
The
two
prevailing
techniques
for
providing
accounts
of
logical
consequence
involve
expressing
the
concept
in
terms
of
proofs
and
via
models
The
study
of
the
syntactic
consequence
of
a
logic
is
called
its
proof
theory
whereas
the
study
of
its
semantic
consequence
is
called
its
model
theory

Warrant-based
accounts
edit
The
accounts
considered
above
are
all
truth-preservational
in
that
they
all
assume
that
the
characteristic
feature
of
a
good
inference
is
that
it
never
allows
one
to
move
from
true
premises
to
an
untrue
conclusion
As
an
alternative
some
have
proposed
warrant-preservational
accounts
according
to
which
the
characteristic
feature
of
a
good
inference
is
that
it
never
allows
one
to
move
from
justifiably
assertible
premises
to
a
conclusion
that
is
not
justifiably
assertible
This
is
roughly
the
account
favored
by
intuitionists
such
as

Because
this
semantics
allows
a
disjunctive
formula
to
be
true
when
both
of
its
disjuncts
are
true
it
is
an
inclusive
interpretation
of
disjunction
in
contrast
with
exclusive
disjunction
Classical
proof
theoretical
treatments
are
often
given
in
terms
of
rules
such
as
disjunction
introduction
and
disjunction
elimination
Disjunction
has
also
been
given
numerous
non-classical
treatments
motivated
by
problems
including
Aristotle's
sea
battle
argument
Heisenberg's
uncertainty
principle
as
well
as
the
numerous
mismatches
between
classical
disjunction
and
its
nearest
equivalents
in
natural
languages

is
in
contrast
with
an
exclusive
disjunction
which
is
true
when
one
or
the
other
of
the
arguments
are
true
but
not
both
referred
to
as
exclusive
or
or
XOR
When
it
is
necessary
to
clarify
whether
inclusive
or
exclusive
or
is
intended
English
speakers
sometimes
uses
the
phrase
and/or
In
terms
of
logic
this
phrase
is
identical
to
or
but
makes
the
inclusion
of
both
being
true
explicit
Notation
edit
In
logic
and
related
fields
disjunction
is
customarily
notated
with
an
infix
operator

In
the
semantics
of
logic
classical
disjunction
is
a
truth
functional
operation
which
returns
the
truth
value
true
unless
both
of
its
arguments
are
false
Its
semantic

is
standardly

Operators
corresponding

logical
disjunction
exist
in
most
programming
languages
Bitwise

Disjunction
is
often
used
for
bitwise
operations

The
or
operator
can
be
used
to
set
bits
in
a
bit
field
to
1
by
or-ing
the
field
with
a
constant
field
with
the
relevant
bits
set
to
1
For
example
x
x
0
b
00000001
will
force
the
final
bit
to
1
while
leaving
other
bits
unchanged

Logical
operation
edit
Many
languages
distinguish
between
bitwise
and
logical
disjunction
by
providing
two
distinct
operators
in
languages
following
C
bitwise
disjunction
is
performed
with
the
single
pipe
operator
and
logical
disjunction
with
the
double
pipe
operator
Logical
disjunction
is
usually
short-circuited
that
is
if
the
first
left
operand
evaluates
to
true
then
the
second
right
operand
is
not
evaluated
The
logical
disjunction
operator
thus
usually
constitutes
a
sequence
point
In
a
parallel
concurrent
language
it
is
possible
to
short-circuit
both
sides
they
are
evaluated
in
parallel
and
if
one
terminates
with
value
true
the
other
is
interrupted
This
operator
is
thus
called
the
parallel
or
Although
the
type
of
a
logical
disjunction
expression
is
Boolean
in
most
languages
and
thus
can
only
have
the
value
true
or
false
in
some
languages
such
as
Python
and
JavaScript
the
logical
disjunction
operator
returns
one
of
its
operands
the
first
operand
if
it
evaluates
to
a
true
value
and
the
second
operand
otherwise

in
classical
logic
Notably
classical
disjunction
is
inclusive
while
natural
language
disjunction
is
often
understood
exclusively
as
the
following
English
example
typically
would
be
1
Mary
is
eating
an
apple
or
a
pear
This
inference
has
sometimes
been
understood
as
an
entailment
for
instance
by
Alfred
Tarski
who
suggested
that
natural
language
disjunction
is
ambiguous
between
a
classical
and
a
nonclassical
interpretation
More
recent
work
in
pragmatics
has
shown
that
this
inference
can
be
derived
as
a
conversational
implicature
on
the
basis
of
a
semantic
denotation
which
behaves
classically
However
disjunctive
constructions
including
Hungarian
vagy
vagy
and
French
soit
soit
have
been
argued
to
be
inherently
exclusive
rendering
ungrammaticality
in
contexts
where
an
inclusive
reading
would
otherwise
be
forced
1
Similar
deviations
from
classical
logic
have
been
noted
in
cases
such
as
free
choice
disjunction
and
simplification
of
disjunctive
antecedents
where
certain
modal
operators
trigger
a
conjunction-like
interpretation
of
disjunction
As
with
exclusivity
these
inferences
have
been
analyzed
both
as
implicatures
and
as
entailments
arising
from
a
nonclassical
interpretation
of
disjunction

In
many
languages
disjunctive
expressions
play
a
role
in
question
formation
Is
Mary
a
philosopher
or
a
linguist
For
instance
while
the
above
English
example
can
be
interpreted
as
a
polar
question
asking
whether
it's
true
that
Mary
is
either
a
philosopher
or
a
linguist
it
can
also
be
interpreted
as
an
alternative
question
asking
which
of
the
two
professions
is
hers
The
role
of
disjunction
in
these
cases
has
been
analyzed
using
nonclassical
logics
such
as
alternative
semantics
and
inquisitive
semantics
which
have
also
been
adopted
to
explain
the
free
choice
and
simplification
inferences

In
English
as
in
many
other
languages
disjunction
is
expressed
by
a
coordinating
conjunction
Other
languages
express
disjunctive
meanings
in
a
variety
of
ways
though
it
is
unknown
whether
disjunction
itself
is
a
linguistic
universal
In
many
languages
such
as
Dyirbal
and
Maricopa
disjunction
is
marked
using
a
verb
suffix
For
instance
in
the
Maricopa
example
below
disjunction
is
marked
by
the
suffix

Way
to
specify
the
location
of
data
on
computer
storage
devices
Logical
block
addressing
LBA
is
a
common
scheme
used
for
specifying
the
location
of
blocks
of
data
stored
on
computer
storage
devices
generally
secondary
storage
systems
such
as
hard
disk
drives
LBA
is
a
particularly
simple
linear
addressing
scheme
blocks
are
located
by
an
integer
index
with
the
first
block
being
LBA
0
the
second
LBA
1
and
so
on
The
IDE
standard
included
22
bit
LBA
as
an
option
which
was
further
extended
to
28
bit
with
the
release
of
ATA
1
1994
and
to
48
bit
with
the
release
of
ATA
6
2003
whereas
the
size
of
entries
in
on-disk
and
in-memory
data
structures
holding
the
address
is
typically
32
or
64
bits
Most
hard
disk
drives
released
after
1996
implement
logical
block
addressing
Overview
edit
See
also
Fixed-block
architecture
In
logical
block
addressing
only
one
number
is
used
to
address
data
and
each
linear
base
address
describes
a
single
block
The
LBA
scheme
replaces
earlier
schemes
which
exposed
the
physical
details
of
the
storage
device
to
the
software
of
the
operating
system
Chief
among
these
was
the
cylinder-head-sector
CHS
scheme
where
blocks
were
addressed
by
means
of
a
tuple
which
defined
the
cylinder
head
and
sector
at
which
they
appeared
on
the
hard
disk
CHS
did
not
map
well
to
devices
other
than
hard
disks
such
as
tapes
and
networked
storage
and
was
generally
not
used
for
them
CHS
was
used
in
early
MFM
and
RLL
drives
and
both
it
and
its
successor
extended
cylinder-head-sector
ECHS
were
used
in
the
first
ATA
drives
However
current
disk
drives
use
zone
bit
recording
where
the
number
of
sectors
per
track
depends
on
the
track
number
Even
though
the
disk
drive
will
report
some
CHS
values
as
sectors
per
track
SPT
and
heads
per
cylinder
HPC
they
have
little
to
do
with
the
disk
drive's
true
geometry
LBA
was
first
introduced
in
1981
by
SASI
the
precursor
of
SCSI
as
an
abstraction
While
the
drive
controller
still
addresses
data
blocks
by
their
CHS
address
this
information
is
generally
not
used
by
the
SCSI
device
driver
the
OS
filesystem
code
or
any
applications
such
as
databases
that
access
the
raw
disk
System
calls
requiring
block-level
I/O
pass
LBA
definitions
to
the
storage
device
driver
for
simple
cases
where
one
volume
maps
to
one
physical
drive
this
LBA
is
then
passed
directly
to
the
drive
controller
In
redundant
array
of
independent
disks
RAID
devices
and
storage
area
networks
SANs
and
where
logical
drives
logical
unit
numbers
LUNs
are
composed
via
LUN
virtualization
and
aggregation
LBA
addressing
of
individual
disk
should
be
translated
by
a
software
layer
to
provide
uniform
LBA
addressing
for
the
entire
storage
device

INT

The
earlier
IDE
standard
from
Western
Digital
introduced
22
bit
LBA
in
1994
the
ATA
1
standard
allowed
for
28
bit
addresses
in
both
LBA
and
CHS
modes
The
CHS
scheme
used
16
bits
for
cylinder
4
bits
for
head
and
8
bits
for
sector
counting
sectors
from
1
to
255
This
means
the
reported
number
of
heads
never
exceeds
16
0
15
the
number
of
sectors
can
be
255
1
255
though
63
is
often
the
largest
used
and
the
number
of
cylinders
can
be
as
large
as
65
536
0
65535
limiting
disk
size
to
128
GiB
137
4
GB
assuming
512
byte
sectors
These
values
can
be
accessed
by
issuing
the
ATA
command
Identify
Device
ECh
to
the
drive
1
87
However
the
IBM
BIOS
implementation
defined
in
the
INT
13
h
disk
access
routines
used
quite
a
different
24
bit
scheme
for
CHS
addressing
with
10
bits
for
cylinder
8
bits
for
head
and
6
bits
for
sector
or
1024
cylinders
256
heads
and
63
sectors
2
This
INT
13
h
implementation
had
pre-dated
the
ATA
standard
as
it
was
introduced
when
the
IBM
PC
had
only
floppy
disk
storage
and
when
hard
disk
drives
were
introduced
on
the
IBM
PC/XT
INT
13
h
interface
could
not
be
practically
redesigned
due
to
backward
compatibility
issues
Overlapping
ATA
CHS
mapping
with
BIOS
CHS
mapping
produced
the
lowest
common
denominator
of
10
4
6
bits
or
1024
cylinders
16
heads
and
63
sectors
which
gave
the
practical
limit
of
1024
16
63
sectors
and
528
MB
504
MiB
assuming
512
byte
sectors
In
order
for
the
BIOS
to
overcome
this
limit
and
successfully
work
with
larger
hard
drives
a
CHS
translation
scheme
had
to
be
implemented
when
in
the
BIOS
disk
I/O
routines
which
would
convert
between
24
bit
CHS
used
by
INT
13
h
and
28
bit
CHS
numbering
used
by
ATA
The
translation
scheme
was
called
large
or
bit
shift
translation
This
method
would
remap
16
4
8
bit
ATA
cylinders
and
heads
to
10
8
6
bit
scheme
used
by
INT
13
h
generating
much
more
virtual
drive
heads
than
the
physical
disk
reported
This
increased
the
practical
limit
to
1024
256
63
sectors
or
8
4
GB
7
8
GiB
To
further
overcome
this
limit
INT
13
h
Extensions
were
introduced
when
with
the
BIOS
Enhanced
Disk
Drive
Services
which
removed
practical
limits
on
disk
size
for
operating
systems
which
are
aware
of
this
new
interface
such
as
the
DOS
7
0
component
in
Windows
95
This
enhanced
BIOS
subsystem
supports
LBA
addressing
with
LBA
or
LBA-assisted
method
which
uses
native
28
bit
LBA
for
addressing
ATA
disks
and
performs
CHS
conversion
as
needed
The
normal
or
none
method
reverts
to
the
earlier
10
4
6
bit
CHS
mode
which
does
not
support

Installation

OEM-version
of
EZ
Drive
on
a
3
5
inch
floppy
disk
Until
the
release
of
ATA
2
standard
in
1996
there
were
a
handful
of
large
hard
drives
which
did
not
support
LBA
addressing
so
only
large
or
normal
methods
could
be
used
However
using
the
large
method
also
introduced
portability
problems
as
different
BIOSes
often
used
different
and
incompatible
translation
methods
and
hard
drives
partitioned
on
a
computer
with
a
BIOS
from
a
particular
vendor
often
could
not
be
read
on
a
computer
with
a
different
make
of
BIOS
The
solution
was
to
use
conversion
software
such
as
OnTrack
Disk
Manager
Micro
House
EZ-Drive/EZ-BIOS
etc
which
installed
to
the
disk's
OS
loader
and
replaced
INT
13
h
routines
at
boot
time
with
custom
code
This
software
could
also
enable
LBA
and
INT

for
older
computers
with
non
LBA-compliant
BIOSes
LBA-assisted
translation
edit
When
the
BIOS
is
configured
to
use
a
disk
in
LBA-assisted
translation
mode
the
BIOS
accesses
the
hardware
using
LBA
mode
but
also
presents
a
translated
CHS
geometry
via
the
INT
13
h
interface
The
number
of
cylinders
heads
and
sectors
in
the
translated
geometry
depends
on
the
total
size
of
the
disk
as
shown
in
the

The
current

was
introduced
in

with
the

raising
the
addressing
limit
to
2
48
512

which
is
exactly
128

approximately

Current

Extensions
which
use
64

structures
for
LBA
addressing
and
should
encompass
any
future

though
modern
operating
systems
implement
direct

and
do
not
use
the

However
the

only
supports

In
the
LBA
addressing
scheme
sectors
are
numbered
as
integer
indexes
when
mapped
to
CHS
cylinder-head-sector
tuples
LBA
numbering
starts
with
the
first
cylinder
first
head
and
track's
first
sector
Once
the
track
is
exhausted
numbering
continues
to
the
second
head
while
staying
inside
the
first
cylinder
Once
all
heads
inside
the
first
cylinder
are
exhausted
numbering
continues
from
the
second
cylinder
etc
Thus
the
lower
the
LBA
value
is
the
closer
the
physical
sector
is
to
the
hard

is

Though

definitely
uses
the
mathematical
concept
of

it
may
also
be
considered
an
example
of
the

called

by
viewing
its

as
having

1970

See

Logic
of
Computable
Functions
Logic
for
Computable
Functions
LCF
is
an
interactive
automated
theorem
prover
developed
at
Stanford
and
Edinburgh
by
Robin
Milner
and
collaborators
in
early
1970
s
based
on
the
theoretical
foundation
of
logic
of
computable
functions
previously
proposed
by
Dana
Scott
Work
on
the
LCF
system
introduced
the
general-purpose
programming
language
ML
to
allow
users
to
write
theorem-proving
tactics
supporting
algebraic
data
types
parametric
polymorphism
abstract
data
types
and
exceptions
Basic
idea
edit
Theorems
in
the
system
are
terms
of
a
special
theorem
abstract
data
type
The
general
mechanism
of
abstract
data
types
of
ML
ensures
that
theorems
are
derived
using
only
the
inference
rules
given
by
the
operations
of
the
theorem
abstract
type
Users
can
write
arbitrarily
complex
ML
programs
to
compute
theorems
the
validity
of
theorems
does
not
depend
on
the
complexity
of
such
programs
but
follows
from
the
soundness
of
the
abstract
data
type
implementation
and
the
correctness
of
the
ML
compiler
Advantages
edit
The
LCF
approach
provides
similar
trustworthiness
to
systems
that
generate
explicit
proof
certificates
but
without
the
need
to
store
proof
objects
in
memory
The
Theorem
data
type
can
be
easily
implemented
to
optionally
store
proof
objects
depending
on
the
system's
run-time
configuration
so
it
generalizes
the
basic
proof-generation
approach
The
design
decision
to
use
a
general-purpose
programming
language
for
developing
theorems
means
that
depending
on
the
complexity
of
programs
written
it
is
possible
to
use
the
same
language
to
write
step-by-step
proofs
decision
procedures
or
theorem
provers
Disadvantages
edit
Trusted
computing
base
edit
The
implementation
of
the
underlying
ML
compiler
adds
to
the
trusted
computing
base
Work
on
CakeML
1
resulted
in
a
formally
verified
ML
compiler
alleviating
some
of
these
concerns
Efficiency
and
complexity
of
proof
procedures
edit
Theorem
proving
often
benefits
from
decision
procedures
and
theorem
proving
algorithms
whose
correctness
has
been
extensively
analyzed
A
straightforward
way
of
implementing
these
procedures
in
an
LCF
approach
requires
such
procedures
to
always
derive
outcomes
from
the
axioms
lemmas
and
inference
rules
of
the
system
as
opposed
to
directly
computing
the
outcome
A
potentially
more
efficient
approach
is
to
use
reflection
to
prove
that
a
function
operating
on
formulas
always
gives
correct
result
2
Influences
edit
Among
subsequent
implementations
is
Cambridge
LCF
Later
systems
simplified
the
logic
to
use
total
instead
of
partial
functions
leading
to
HOL
HOL
Light
and
the
Isabelle
proof
assistant
that
supports
various
logics
As
of
2019
the
Isabelle
proof
assistant
still
contains
an
implementation
of
an
LCF
logic

Logic
in
computer
science
covers
the
overlap
between
the
field
of
logic
and
that
of
computer
science
The
topic
can
essentially
be
divided
into
three
main
areas
Theoretical
foundations
and
analysis
Use
of
computer
technology
to
aid
logicians
Use
of
concepts
from

for
computer
applications
Theoretical
foundations
and
analysis
edit
Logic
plays
a
fundamental
role
in
computer
science
Some
of
the
key
areas
of
logic
that
are
particularly
significant
are
computability
theory
formerly
called
recursion
theory
modal
logic
and
category
theory
The
theory
of
computation
is
based
on
concepts
defined
by
logicians
and
mathematicians
such
as
Alonzo
Church
and
Alan
Turing
1
2
Church
first
showed
the
existence
of
algorithmically
unsolvable
problems
using
his
notion
of
lambda-definability
Turing
gave
the
first
compelling
analysis
of
what
can
be
called
a
mechanical
procedure
and
Kurt
Gödel
asserted
that
he
found
Turing's
analysis
perfect
3
In
addition
some
other
major
areas
of
theoretical
overlap
between
logic
and
computer
science
are
Gödel's
incompleteness
theorem
proves
that
any
logical
system
powerful
enough
to
characterize
arithmetic
will
contain
statements
that
can
neither
be
proved
nor
disproved
within
that
system
This
has
direct
application
to
theoretical
issues
relating
to
the
feasibility
of
proving
the
completeness
and
correctness
of
software
4
The
frame
problem
is
a
basic
problem
that
must
be
overcome
when
using
first-order
logic
to
represent
the
goals
of
an
artificial
intelligence
agent
and
the
state
of
its
environment
5
The
Curry–Howard
correspondence
is
a
relation
between
logical
systems
and
programming
languages
This
theory
established
a
precise
correspondence
between
proofs
and
programs
In
particular
it
showed
that
terms
in
the
simply
typed
lambda
calculus
correspond
to
proofs
of
intuitionistic
propositional
logic
Category
theory
represents
a
view
of
mathematics
that
emphasizes
the
relations
between
structures
It
is
intimately
tied
to
many
aspects
of
computer
science
type
systems
for
programming
languages
the
theory
of
transition
systems
models
of
programming
languages
and
the
theory
of
programming
language
semantics
6
Logic
programming
is
a
programming
database
and
knowledge
representation
paradigm
that
is
based
on
formal
logic
A
logic
program
is
a
set
of
sentences
about
some
problem
domain
Computation
is
performed
by
applying
logical
reasoning
to
solve
problems
in
the
domain
Major
logic
programming
language
families
include
Prolog

One
of
the
first
applications
to
use
the
term
artificial
intelligence
was
the
Logic
Theorist
system
developed
by
Allen
Newell
Cliff
Shaw
and
Herbert
Simon
in
1956
One
of
the
things
that
a
logician
does
is
to
take
a
set
of
statements
in
logic
and
deduce
the
conclusions
additional
statements
that
must
be
true
by
the
laws
of
logic
For
example
if
given
the
statements
All
humans
are
mortal
and
Socrates
is
human
a
valid
conclusion
is
Socrates
is
mortal
Of
course
this
is
a
trivial
example
In
actual
logical
systems
the
statements
can
be
numerous
and
complex
It
was
realized
early
on
that
this
kind
of
analysis
could
be
significantly
aided
by
the
use
of
computers
Logic
Theorist
validated
the
theoretical
work
of
Bertrand
Russell
and
Alfred
North
Whitehead
in
their
influential
work
on
mathematical
logic
called
Principia
Mathematica
In
addition
subsequent
systems
have
been
utilized
by
logicians
to
validate
and
discover
new
mathematical
theorems
and
proofs
7
Logic
applications
for
computers
edit
There
has
always
been
a
strong
influence
from
mathematical
logic
on
the
field
of
artificial
intelligence
AI
From
the
beginning
of
the
field
it
was
realized
that
technology
to
automate
logical
inferences
could
have
great
potential
to
solve
problems
and
draw
conclusions
from
facts
Ron
Brachman
has
described
first-order
logic
FOL
as
the
metric
by
which
all
AI
knowledge
representation
formalisms
should
be
evaluated
First-order
logic
is
a
general
and
powerful
method
for
describing
and
analyzing
information
The
reason
FOL
itself
is
simply
not
used
as
a
computer
language
is
that
it
is
actually
too
expressive
in
the
sense
that
FOL
can
easily
express
statements
that
no
computer
no
matter
how
powerful
could
ever
solve
For
this
reason
every
form
of
knowledge
representation
is
in
some
sense
a
trade
off
between
expressivity
and
computability
The
more
expressive
the
language
is
the
closer
it
is
to
FOL
the
more
likely
it
is
to
be
slower
and
prone
to
an
infinite
loop
8
For
example
IF–THEN
rules
used
in
expert
systems
approximate
to
a
very
limited
subset
of
FOL
Rather
than
arbitrary
formulas
with
the
full
range
of
logical
operators
the
starting
point
is
simply
what
logicians
refer
to
as
modus
ponens
As
a
result
rule-based
systems
can
support
high-performance
computation
especially
if
they
take
advantage
of
optimization
algorithms
and
compilation
9
On
the
other
hand
logic
programming
which
combines
the
Horn
clause
subset
of
first-order
logic
with
a
non-monotonic
form
of
negation
has
both
high
expressive
power
and
efficient
implementations
In
particular
the
logic
programming
language
Prolog
is
a
Turing
complete
programming
language
Datalog
extends
the
relational
database
model
with
recursive
relations
while
answer
set
programming
is
a
form
of
logic
programming
oriented
towards
difficult
primarily

Another
major
area
of
research
for
logical
theory
is
software
engineering
Research
projects
such
as
the
Knowledge
Based
Software
Assistant
and
Programmer's
Apprentice
programs
have
applied
logical
theory
to
validate
the
correctness
of
software
specifications
They
have
also
used
logical
tools
to
transform
the
specifications
into
efficient
code
on
diverse
platforms
and
to
prove
the
equivalence
between
the
implementation
and
the
specification
10
This
formal
transformation-driven
approach
is
often
far
more
effortful
than
traditional
software
development
However
in
specific
domains
with
appropriate
formalisms
and
reusable
templates
the
approach
has
proven
viable
for
commercial
products
The
appropriate
domains
are
usually
those
such
as
weapons
systems
security
systems
and
real-time
financial
systems
where
failure
of
the
system
has
excessively
high
human
or
financial
cost
An
example
of
such
a
domain
is
Very
Large
Scale
Integrated
VLSI
design—the
process
for
designing
the
chips
used
for
the
CPUs
and
other
critical
components
of
digital
devices
An
error
in
a
chip
can
be
catastrophic
Unlike
software
chips
can't
be
patched
or
updated
As
a
result
there
is
commercial
justification
for
using
formal
methods
to
prove
that
the
implementation
corresponds
to
the
specification
11
Another
important
application
of
logic
to
computer
technology
has
been
in
the
area
of
frame
languages
and
automatic
classifiers
Frame
languages
such
as
KL-ONE
can
be
directly
mapped
to
set
theory
and
first-order
logic
This
allows
specialized
theorem
provers
called
classifiers
to
analyze
the
various
declarations
between
sets
subsets
and
relations
in
a
given
model
In
this
way
the
model
can
be
validated
and
any
inconsistent
definitions
flagged
The
classifier
can
also
infer
new
information
for
example
define
new
sets
based
on
existing
information
and
change
the
definition
of
existing
sets
based
on
new
data
The
level
of
flexibility
is
ideal
for
handling
the
ever
changing
world
of
the
Internet
Classifier
technology
is
built
on
top
of
languages
such
as
the
Web
Ontology
Language
to
allow
a
logical
semantic
level
on
top
of
the
existing
Internet
This
layer
is
called
the
Semantic
Web
12

Temporal
logic
is
used
for
reasoning
in
concurrent
systems

The

in

is
that

now
have

clear
very

the
bad

is

Logic
analyzer
A
logic
analyzer
is
an
electronic
instrument
that
captures
and
displays
multiple
logic
signals
from
a
digital
system
or
digital
circuit
A
logic
analyzer
may
convert
the
captured
data
into
timing
diagrams
protocol
decodes
state
machine
traces
opcodes
or
may
correlate
opcodes
with
source-level
software
Logic
analyzers
have
advanced
triggering
capabilities
and
are
useful
when
a
user
needs
to
see
the
timing
relationships
between
many
signals
in
a
digital
system
1
Overview
edit
Presently
there
are
three
distinct
categories
of
logic
analyzers
available
on
the
market
Modular
LAs
which
consist
of
both
a
chassis
or
mainframe
and
logic
analyzer
modules
2
The
mainframe/chassis
contains
the
display
controls
control
computer
and
multiple
slots
into
which
the
actual
data-capturing
hardware
is
installed
The
modules
each
have
a
specific
number
of
channels
and
multiple
modules
may
be
combined
to
obtain
a
very
high
channel
count
While
modular
logic
analyzers
are
typically
more
expensive
the
ability
to
combine
multiple
modules
to
obtain
a
high
channel
count
and
the
generally
higher
performance
of
modular
logic
analyzers
often
justifies
the
price
For
the
very
high
end
modular
logic
analyzers
the
user
often
must
provide
their
own
host
PC
or
purchase
an
embedded
controller
compatible
with
the
system

sometimes

LAs
Portable
logic
analyzers
integrate
everything
into
a
single
package
with
options
installed
at
the
factory
While
portable
logic
analyzers
generally
have
lower
performance
than
their
modular
counterparts
they
are
often
used
for
general
purpose
debugging
by
cost
conscious
users
PC-based
LAs
The
hardware
connects
to
a
computer
through
a
USB
or
Ethernet
connection
and
relays
the
captured
signals
to
the
software
on
the
computer
These
devices
are
typically
much
smaller
and
less
expensive
because
they
make
use
of
a
PC's
existing
keyboard
display
and
CPU
Operation
edit
A
logic
analyzer
can
be
triggered
on
a
complicated
sequence
of
digital
events
then
capture
a
large
amount
of
digital
data
from
the
system
under
test
SUT
When
logic
analyzers
first
came
into
use
it
was
common
to
attach
several
hundred
clips
to
a
digital
system
Later
specialized
connectors
came
into
use
The
evolution
of
logic
analyzer
probes
has
led
to
a
common
footprint
that
multiple
vendors
support
which
provides
added
freedom
to
end
users
Introduced
in
April
2002
connectorless
technology
identified
by
several
vendor-specific
trade
names
Compression
Probing
Soft
Touch
D-Max
has
become
popular
These
probes
provide
a
durable
reliable
mechanical
and
electrical
connection
between
the
probe
and
the
circuit
board
with
less
than
0
5
to
0
7
pF
loading
per
signal
Once
the
probes
are
connected
the
user
programs
the
analyzer
with
the
names
of
each
signal
and
can
group
several
signals
together
for
easier
manipulation
Next
a
capture
mode
is
chosen
either
timing
mode
where
the
input
signals
are
sampled
at
regular
intervals
based
on
an
internal
or
external
clock
source
or
state
mode
where
one
or
more
of
the
signals
are
defined
as
clocks
and
data
are
taken
on
the
rising
or
falling
edges
of
these
clocks
optionally
using
other
signals
to
qualify
these
clocks
After
the
mode
is
chosen
a
trigger
condition
must
be
set
A
trigger
condition
can
range
from
simple
such
as
triggering
on
a
rising
or
falling
edge
of
a
single
signal
to
the
very
complex
such
as
configuring
the
analyzer
to
decode
the
higher
levels
of
the
TCP/IP
stack
and
triggering
on
a
certain
HTTP
packet
At
this
point
the
user
sets
the
analyzer
to
run
mode
either
triggering
once
or
repeatedly
triggering
Once
the
data
are
captured
they
can
be
displayed
several
ways
from
the
simple
showing
waveforms
or
state
listings
to
the
complex
showing
decoded
Ethernet
protocol
traffic
Some
analyzers
can
also
operate
in
a
compare
mode
where
they
compare
each
captured
data
set
to
a
previously
recorded
data
set
and
halt
capture
or
visually
notify
the
operator
when
this
data
set
is
either
matched
or
not
This
is
useful
for
long-term
empirical
testing
Recent
analyzers
can
even
be
set
to
email
a
copy
of
the
test
data
to
the
engineer
on
a
successful
trigger
Uses
edit
Many
digital
designs
including
those
of
ICs
are
simulated
to
detect
defects
before
the
unit
is
constructed
The
simulation
usually
provides
logic
analysis
displays
Often
complex
discrete
logic
is
verified
by
simulating
inputs
and
testing
outputs
using
boundary
scan
Logic
analyzers
can
uncover
hardware
defects
that
are
not
found
in
simulation
These
problems
are
typically
too
difficult
to
model
in
simulation
or
too
time-consuming
to
simulate
and
often
cross
multiple
clock
domains
Field-programmable
gate
arrays
have
become
a
common
measurement
point
for
logic
analyzers
and
are
also
used
to
debug
the
logic
circuit
Logic
Analyzers
are
also
very
useful
when
it
comes
to
analyze
serial
protocols
like
I
2
C
SPI
or
UART
as
they
allow
to
capture
long
logic
sequences
showing
one
or
several
communication
frames
Usually
the
Logic
Analyzer
software
will
also
interpret
the
protocol
layer
making
debugging
of
firmware
less
tedious
task
History
edit
As
digital
computing
and
integrated
circuits
emerged
in
the
1960
s
5
new
and
difficult
problems
began
to
arise
problems
that
oscilloscopes
had
trouble
handling
For
the
first
time
in
computing
history
it
became
essential
to
simultaneously
view
large
numbers
of
signals
Early
solutions
attempted
to
combine
hardware
from
multiple
oscilloscopes
into
one
package
but
screen
clutter
a
lack
of
definite
data
interpretation
as
well
as
probing
constraints
made
this
solution
only
marginally
usable
The
HP
5000
A
Logic
Analyzer
introduced
in
the
October
1973
issue
of
the
Hewlett-Packard
Journal
was
probably
the
first
commercially
available
instrument
to
be
called
a

However
the
HP

was
limited
to
two
channels

presented
information
by
means
of
two
rows
of
32

The
first
truly

was
the

it
was
a

Mixed-signal
oscilloscopes
edit
Mixed-signal
oscilloscopes
combine
the
functionality
of
a
digital
storage
oscilloscope
with
a
logic
analyzer
The
several
benefits
of
these
include
the
ability
to
view
analog
and
digital
signals
together
in
time
and
to
trigger
on
either
digital
or
analog
signals
and
capture
on
the
other
A
few
limitations
of
mixed
signal
oscilloscopes
are
that
they
do
not
capture
state-mode
data
they
have
a
limited
channel
count
and
do
not
provide
the
analytical
depth
and
insight
of
a
logic
analyzer

Intentional
delayed
sabotage
of
a
computer
program
with
activation
subject
to
conditions
A
logic
bomb
is
a
piece
of
code
intentionally
inserted
into
a
software
system
that
will
set
off
a
malicious
function
when
specified
conditions
are
met
For
example
a
programmer
may
hide
a
piece
of
code
that
starts
deleting
files
such
as
a
salary
database
trigger
should
they
ever
be
terminated
from
the
company
Software
that
is
inherently
malicious
such
as
viruses
and
worms
often
contain
logic
bombs
that
execute
a
certain
payload
at
a
pre-defined
time
or
when
some
other
condition
is
met
This
technique
can
be
used
by
a
virus
or
worm
to
gain
momentum
and
spread
before
being
noticed
Some
viruses
attack
their
host
systems
on
specific
dates
such
as
Friday
the
13
th
or
April
Fools
Day
Trojans
and
other
computer
viruses
that
activate
on
certain
dates
are
often
called
time
bombs
To
be
considered
a
logic
bomb
the
payload
should
be
unwanted
and
unknown
to
the
user
of
the
software
As
an
example
trial
programs
with
code
that
disables
certain
functionality
after
a
set
time
are
not
normally
regarded
as
logic
bombs

In
June
2006
Roger
Duronio
a
system
administrator
for
UBS
was
charged
with
using
a
logic
bomb
to
damage
the
company's
computer
network
and
with
securities
fraud
for
his
failed
plan
to
drive
down
the
company's
stock
with
activation
of
the
logic
bomb
1

Duronio
was
later
convicted
and
sentenced
to
8
years
and
1
month
in
prison
as
well
as
a
3
1
million
restitution
to
UBS
3
On
20
March
2013
in
an
attack
launched
against
South
Korea
a
logic
bomb
struck
machines
and
wiped
the
hard
drives
and
master
boot
records
of
at
least
three
banks
and
two
media
companies
simultaneously
4

Symantec
reported
that
the
malware
also
contained
a
component
that
was
capable
of
wiping
Linux
machines

On
19
July
2019
David
Tinley
a
contract
employee
pleaded
guilty
for
programming
logic
bombs
within
the
software
he
created
for
Siemens
Corporation
8
The
software
was
intentionally
made
to
malfunction
after
a
certain
amount
of
time
requiring
the
company
to
hire
him
to
fix
it
for
a
fee
The
logic
bombs
went
undetected
for
two
years
but
were
then
discovered
while
he
was
out
of
town
and
had
to
hand
over
the
administrative
password
to
his
software
9
In
2023
researchers
discovered
that
some
Newag
trains
were
secretly
programmed
to
deliberately
break
down
after
a
certain
distance
or
during
maintenance
windows
or
when
onboard
GPS
confirmed
they
were
located
in
rivals
workshops
for
repair

Tony
Xiaotong
Yu
indicted
before
a
grand
jury
was
accused
of
planting
a
logic
bomb
during
his
employment
as
a
programmer
and
securities
trader
at
Deutsche
Morgan
Grenfell
The
bomb
planted
in
1996
had
a
trigger
date
of
20
July
2000
but
was
discovered
by
other
programmers
in
the
company
Removing
and
cleaning
up
after
the
bomb
allegedly
took
several
months

2003
Yung-Hsun
Lin
also
known
as
Andy
Lin
changed
code
on
a
server
at
Medco
Health
Solutions
Inc
s
Fair
Lawn
New

headquarters
where
he
was
employed
as
a
Unix
administrator
creating
a
logic
bomb
set
to
go
off
on
his
birthday
in
2004
It
failed
to
work
due
to
a
programming
error
so
Lin
corrected
the
error
and
reset
it
to
go
off
on
his
next
birthday
but
it
was
discovered
and
disabled
by
a
Medco
computer
systems
administrator
a
few
months
before
the
trigger
date
Lin
pleaded
guilty
and
was
sentenced
to
30
months
in
jail
in
a
federal
prison
in
addition
to
81
200
in
restitution
The
charges
held
a
maximum
sentence
of
10
years
and
a
fine
of
US

On
29
October
2008
a
logic
bomb
was
discovered
at
American
mortgage
giant
Fannie
Mae
The
bomb
was
planted
by
Rajendrasinh
Babubhai
Makwana
an
IT
contractor
who
worked
at
Fannie
Mae's
Urbana
Maryland
facility
The
bomb
was
set
to
activate
on
31
January
2009
and
could
have
wiped
all
of
Fannie
Mae's
4000
servers
Makwana
had
been
terminated
around
1
00
p.m
on
24
October
2008
and
managed
to
plant
the
bomb
before
his
network
access
was
revoked
Makwana
was
indicted
in
a
Maryland
court
on
27
January
2009
for
unauthorized
computer
access

In
October
2009
Douglas
Duchak
was
terminated
from
his
job
as
data
analyst
at
the
Colorado
Springs
Operations
Center
CSOC
of
the
U.S
Transportation
Security
Administration
Surveillance
cameras
captured
images
of
Duchak
entering
the
facility
after
hours
and
loading
a
logic
bomb
onto
a
CSOC
server
that
stored
data
from
the
U.S
Marshals
In
January
2011
Duchak
was
sentenced
to
two
years
in
prison
60
587
in
fines
and
three
years
on
probation
18
At
his
sentencing
Duchak
tearfully
apologized
as
his
lawyer
noted
that
at
the
time
of
the
incident
Duchak's
wife
was
pregnant
with
their
second
child
The
judge
at
the
sentencing
mentioned
that
this
logic
bomb
planting
incident
was
an
anomaly
in
an
otherwise
untarnished
work
history

Alleged
edit
Thomas
C
Reed
wrote
in
his
2004
book
At
the
Abyss
An
Insider's
History
of
the
Cold
War
that
in
1982
a
sabotage
occurred
on
the
Trans-Siberian
Pipeline
because
of
a
logic
bomb
According
to
Reed
a
KGB
operative
stole
the
plans
for
a
sophisticated
control
system
and
its
software
from
a
Canadian
firm
for
use
on
its
Siberian
pipeline
The
Central
Intelligence
Agency
CIA
was
tipped
off
by
documents
in
the
Farewell
Dossier
and
had
the
company
insert
a
logic
bomb
in
the
program
for
sabotage
purposes

Critics

THE
LOGIC
OF
ECONOMICS
Economic
life
is
an
enormously
complicated
hive
of
activity
with
people
buying
selling
bargaining
in
vesting
persuading
and
threatening
The
ultimate
purpose
of
economic
science
and
of
this
text
is
to
understand
this
complex
undertaking
How
do
economists
go
about
their
task
Economists
use
the
scientific
approach
to
understand
economic
life
This
involves
observing
economic
affairs
and
drawing
upon
statistics
and
the
historical
record
For
complex
phenomena
like
the
impacts
of
gelled
deficits
or
the
causes
of
inflation
historical
research
has
provided
a
rich
mine
of
insights
Often
economics
relies
upon
analyses
and
theories
Theoretical
approaches
allow
economists
to
make
broad
generalizations
such
as
those
concerning
the
advantages
of
international
trade
and
specialization
or
the
disadvantages
of
tariffs
and
quotas
In
addition
economists
have
developed
a
specialized
technique
known
as
econometric
which
applies
the
tools
of
statistics
to
economic
problems
Using
econometric
economists
can
sift
through
mountains
of
data
to
extract
simple
relationships.Budding
economists
must
also
be
alert
to
common
fallacies
in
economic
reasoning
Because
economic
relationships
are
often
complex
involving
many
different
variables
it
is
easy
to
become
confused
about
the
exact
reason
behind
events
or
the
impact
of
policies
on
the
economy
The
following
are
some
of
the
common
fallacies
encountered
in
economic
reasoning
The
post
hoc
fallacy
The
first
fallacy
involves
the
inference
of
causality
The
post
hoc
fallacy
occur.s
when
tilt
assume
that
because
on
event
occurred
before
another
event
the
fir.st
event
Taurus
the
second
event
2
An
example
of
this
syndrome
occurred
in
the
Great
Depression
of
the
1930
s
in
the
United
States
Some
people
had
observed
that
periods
of
business
expansion
were
preceded
or
accompanied
by
rising
prices
From
this
they
concluded
that
the
appropriate
remedy
for
depression
was
to
raise
wages
and
prices
This
idea
led
to
a
host
of
legislation
and
regulations
to
prop
lip
wages
and
prices
in
an
inefficient
manner
Did
these
measures
promote
economic
recovery
Almost
surely
not
Indeed
they
probably
slowed
recovery
which
did
not
occur
until
total
spending
Post
hoc
is
shorthand
for
post
hoc
prop
hoc
Translated
from
the
Latin
the
full
expression
means
after
this
therefore
necessarily
because
of
this
began
to
rise
as
the
government
increased
military
spending
ill
preparation
for
World
War
II
Failure
10
hold
other
Hings
constant
A
second
pitfall
is
failure
to
hold
other
things
constant
when
thinking
about
an
issue
For
example
we
might
want
to
know
whether
raising
tax
rates
will
raise
or
lower
tax
revenues
Some
people
have
put
forth
the
seductive
argument
that
we
can
eat
our
fiscal
cake
and
have
it
too
They
argue
that
cutting
tax
rates
will
at
the
same
time
raise
government
revenues
and
lower
the
budget
deficit
They
point
to
the
Kennedy:Johnson
tax
cuts
of
1964
which
lowered
tax
rates
sharply
and
were
followed
by
an
increase
in
government
revenues
in
1965
Hence
they
argue
lower
tax
rates
produce
higher
revenues
What
is
wrong
with
this
reasoning
This
argument
overlooks
the
fact
that
the
economy
grew
from
1964
to
1965
Because
people’s
incomes
grew
during
that
period
government
revenues
also
grew
even
though
tax
rates
were
lower
Careful
studies
indicate
that
revenues
would
have
been
even
higher
in
1965
had
tax
rates
not
been
lowered
in
1964
hence
this
analysis
fails
to
hold
other
things
namely
total
income
constant
Remember
to
hold
other
things
constant
when
you
are
analyzing
the
impact
of
variable
on
the
economic
system
The
fallacy
of
composition
Sometimes
we
assume
that
what
holds
true
for
part
of
a
system
also
holds
true
for
the
whole
In
economics
however,we
often
find
that
the
whole
is
different
from
the
sum
of
the
parts.when
you
assume
that
what
is
true
for
the
part
is
also
true
for
whole
you
are
for
the
whole
committing
the
fallacy
of
composition
Here
are
some
true
statements
that
might
surprise
surprise
you
if
you
ignored
the
fallacy
of
composition
I
If
one
farmer
has
a
bumper
crop
she
has
a
higher
income
if
all
farmers
produce
it
record
crop
farm
incomes
will
fall
2
If
one
person
receives
a
great
d
11
more
money
that
person
will
be
better
off
if
everyone
receives
a
great
deal
more
money
the
society
is
likely
10
be
worse
off
3
If
a
high
tartaric
is
put
on
the
product
of
a
particular
industry
the
producers
in
I
hat
industry
are
likely
to
profit
if
hi
h
tariffs
an
put
on
all
industries
most
producers
and
consumers
will
be
worse
off
I’these
examples
contain
no
tricks
or
magic.Rather
they
are
the
results
of
systems
of
interacting
individuals
Often
the
behavior
of
the
aggregate
looks
very
different
from
the
behavior
of
individual
people
We
mention
these
fallacies
only
briefly
in
this
introduction
Later
as
we
introduce
the
tools
of
economics,we
will
provide
examples
of
how
inattention
to
the
logic
of
economics
can
lead
you
to
false
and
sometimes
costly
errors
When
you
reach
the
end
of
this
book
you
can
look
back
to
see
why
each
of
these
paradoxical
examples
is
true

Logic
yields
validity
not
truth
Post
by
Ziya
on
Boldomatic
To
be
analytical
and
logical
is
something
most
people
find
recommendable
These
words
have
a
positive
connotation
Scientists
think
more
deeply
than
most
other
people
because
they
use
logical
and
analytical
methods
In
dictionaries
logic
is
often
defined
as
reasoning
conducted
or
assessed
according
to
strict
principles
of
validity
and
analysis
as
having
to
do
with
breaking
something
down
But
that’s
not
the
whole
picture
As
used
in
science
analysis
usually
means
something
more
specific
It
means
to
separate
a
problem
into
its
constituent
elements
so
as
to
reduce
complex
and
often
complicated
wholes
into
smaller
simpler
and
more
manageable
parts
You
take
the
whole
and
break
it
down
decompose
into
its
separate
parts
Looking
at
the
parts
separately
one
at
a
time
you
are
supposed
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
how
these
parts
operate
and
work
Built
on
that
more
or
less
atomistic
knowledge
you
are
then
supposed
to
be
able
to
predict
and
explain
the
behaviour
of
the
complex
and
complicated
whole
In
economics
that
means
you
take
the
economic
system
and
divide
it
into
its
separate
parts
analyse
these
parts
one
at
a
time
and
then
after
analysing
the
parts
separately
you
put
the
pieces
together
The
analytical
approach
is
typically
used
in
economic
modelling
where
you
start
with
a
simple
model
with
few
isolated
and
idealized
variables
By
successive
approximations
you
then
add
more
and
more
variables
and
finally
get
a
true
model
of
the
whole
This
may
sound
like
a
convincing
and
good
scientific
approach
But
there
is
a
snag
The
procedure
only
really
works
when
you
have
a
machine-like
whole/system/economy
where
the
parts
appear
in
fixed
and
stable
configurations
And
if
there
is
anything
we
know
about
reality
it
is
that
it
is
not
a
machine
The
world
we
live
in
is
not
a
closed
system
On
the
contrary
it
is
an
essentially
open
system
Things
are
uncertain
relational
interdependent
complex
and
ever-changing
Without
assuming
that
the
underlying
structure
of
the
economy
that
you
try
to
analyze
remains
stable/invariant/constant
there
is
no
chance
the
equations
of
the
model
remain
constant
That’s
the
very
rationale
why
economists
use
often
only
implicitly
the
assumption
of
ceteris
paribus
But
nota
bene
this
can
only
be
a
hypothesis
You
have
to
argue
the
case
If
you
cannot
supply
any
sustainable
justifications
or
warrants
for
the
adequacy
of
making
that
assumption
then
the
whole
analytical
economic
project
becomes
pointless
non-informative
nonsense
Not
only
do
we
have
to
assume
that
we
can
shield
variables
from
each
other
analytically
external
closure
but
we
also
have
to
assume
that
each
and
every
variable
themselves
are
amenable
to
be
understood
as
stable
and
regularity-producing
machines
internal
closure
Which
of
course
we
know
is
as
a
rule
not
possible
Some
things
relations
and
structures
are
not
analytically
graspable
Trying
to
analyse
parenthood
marriage
employment
etc
piece
by
piece
doesn’t
make
sense
To
be
a
chieftain
a
capital
owner
or
a
slave
is
not
an
individual
property
of
an
individual
It
can
come
about
only
when
individuals
are
integral
parts
of
certain
social
structures
and
positions
Social
relations
and
contexts
cannot
be
reduced
to
individual
phenomena
A
cheque
presupposes
a
banking
system
and
being
a
tribe-member
presupposes
a
tribe
Not
taking
this
into
account
in
their
analytical
approach
economic
analysis
becomes
uninformative
nonsense
Using
logical
and
analytical
methods
in
social
sciences
means
that
economists
succumb
to
the
fallacy
of
composition
the
belief
that
the
whole
is
nothing
but
the
sum
of
its
parts
In
society
and
in
the
economy
this
is
arguably
not
the
case
An
adequate
analysis
of
society
and
economy
a
fortiori
cannot
proceed
by
just
adding
up
the
acts
and
decisions
of
individuals
The
whole
is
more
than
a
sum
of
parts
Mainstream
economics
is
built
on
using
the
analytical
method
The
models
built
with
this
method
presuppose
that
social
reality
is
closed
Since
social
reality
is
known
to
be
fundamentally
open
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
models
of
that
kind
can
explain
anything
about
what
happens
in
such
a
universe
Postulating
closed
conditions
to
make
models
operational
and
then
imputing
these
closed
conditions
to
society’s
real
structure
is
an
unwarranted
procedure
that
does
not
take
necessary
ontological
considerations
seriously
Faced
with
the
kind
of
methodological
individualism
and
rational
choice
theory
that
dominate
mainstream
economics
we
have
to
admit
that
even
if
knowing
the
aspirations
and
intentions
of
individuals
are
necessary
prerequisites
for
giving
explanations
of
social
events
they
are
far
from
sufficient
Even
the
most
elementary
rational
actions
in
society
presuppose
the
existence
of
social
forms
that
it
is
not
possible
to
reduce
to
the
intentions
of
individuals
Here
the
analytical
method
fails
again
The
overarching
flaw
with
the
analytical
economic
approach
using
methodological
individualism
and
rational
choice
theory
is
basically
that
they
reduce
social
explanations
to
purportedly
individual
characteristics
But
many
of
the
characteristics
and
actions
of
the
individual
originate
in
and
are
made
possible
only
through
society
and
its
relations
Society
is
not
a
Wittgensteinian
Tractatus-world
characterized
by
atomistic
states
of
affairs
Society
is
not
reducible
to
individuals
since
the
social
characteristics
forces
and
actions
of
the
individual
are
determined
by
pre-existing
social
structures
and
positions
Even
though
society
is
not
a
volitional
individual
and
the
individual
is
not
an
entity
given
outside
of
society
the
individual
actor
and
the
society
structure
have
to
be
kept
analytically
distinct
They
are
tied
together
through
the
individual’s
reproduction
and
transformation
of
already
given
social
structures
Since
at
least
the
marginal
revolution
in
economics
in
the
1870
s
it
has
been
an
essential
feature
of
economics
to
analytically
treat
individuals
as
essentially
independent
and
separate
entities
of
action
and
decision
But
really
in
such
a
complex
organic
and
evolutionary
system
as
an
economy
that
kind
of
independence
is
a
deeply
unrealistic
assumption
to
make
To
simply
assume
that
there
is
strict
independence
between
the
variables
we
try
to
analyze
doesn’t
help
us
the
least
if
that
hypothesis
turns
out
to
be
unwarranted
To
be
able
to
apply
the
analytical
approach
economists
have
to
basically
assume
that
the
universe
consists
of
atoms
that
exercise
their
own
separate
and
invariable
effects
in
such
a
way
that
the
whole
consists
of
nothing
but
an
addition
of
these
separate
atoms
and
their
changes
These
simplistic
assumptions
of
isolation
atomicity
and
additivity
are
however
at
odds
with
reality
In
real-world
settings
we
know
that
the
ever-changing
contexts
make
it
futile
to
search
for
knowledge
by
making
such
reductionist
assumptions
Real-world
individuals
are
not
reducible
to
contentless
atoms
and
so
not
susceptible
to
atomistic
analysis
The
world
is
not
reducible
to
a
set
of
atomistic
individuals
and
states
How
variable
X
works
and
influences
real-world
economies
in
situation
A
cannot
simply
be
assumed
to
be
understood
or
explained
by
looking
at
how
X
works
in
situation
B
Knowledge
of
X
probably
does
not
tell
us
much
if
we
do
not
take
into
consideration
how
it
depends
on
Y
and
Z
It
can
never
be
legitimate
just
to
assume
that
the
world
is
atomistic
Assuming
real-world
additivity
cannot
be
the
right
thing
to
do
if
the
things
we
have
around
us
rather
than
being
atoms
are
organic
entities
If
we
want
to
develop
new
and
better
economics
we
have
to
give
up
on
the
single-minded
insistence
on
using
a
deductivist
straitjacket
methodology
and
the
analytical
method
To
focus
scientific
endeavours
on
proving
things
in
models
is
a
gross
misapprehension
of
the
purpose
of
economic
theory
Deductivist
models
and
analytical
methods
disconnected
from
reality
are
not
relevant
to
predicting
explaining
or
understanding
real-world
economies
To
have
consistent
models
and
valid
evidence
is
not
enough
What
economics
needs
are
real-world
relevant
models
and
sound
evidence
Aiming
only
for
consistency
and
validity
is
setting
the
economics
aspirations
level
too
low
for
developing
a
realist
and
relevant
science
Economics
is
not
mathematics
or
logic
It’s
about
society
The
real
world
Models
may
help
us
think
through
problems
But
we
should
never
forget
that
the
formalism
we
use
in
our
models
is
not
self-evidently
transportable
to
a
largely
unknown
and
uncertain
reality
The
tragedy
with
mainstream
economic
theory
is
that
it
thinks
that
the
logic
and
mathematics
used
are
sufficient
for
dealing
with
our
real-world
problems
They
are
not
Model
deductions
based
on
questionable
assumptions
can
never
be
anything
but
pure
exercises
in
hypothetical
reasoning
The
world
in
which
we
live
is
inherently
uncertain
and
quantifiable
probabilities
are
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
Every
statement
about
it
is
attached
a
weight
of
argument
that
makes
it
impossible
to
reduce
our
beliefs
and
expectations
to
a
one-dimensional
stochastic
probability
distribution
If
God
does
not
play
dice
as
Einstein
maintained
I
would
add
nor
do
people
The
world
as
we
know
it
has
limited
scope
for
certainty
and
perfect
knowledge
Its
intrinsic
and
almost
unlimited
complexity
and
the
interrelatedness
of
its
organic
parts
prevent
the
possibility
of
treating
it
as
constituted
by
legal
atoms
with
discretely
distinct
separable
and
stable
causal
relations
Our
knowledge
accordingly
has
to
be
of
a
rather
fallible
kind
If
the
real
world
is
fuzzy
vague
and
indeterminate
then
why
should
our
models
build
upon
a
desire
to
describe
it
as
precise
and
predictable
Even
if
there
always
has
to
be
a
trade-off
between
theory-internal
validity
and
external
validity
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
if
our
models
are
relevant
Human
logic
has
to
supplant
the
classical
formal
logic
of
deductivism
if
we
want
to
have
anything
of
interest
to
say
of
the
real
world
we
inhabit
Logic
is
a
marvellous
tool
in
mathematics
and
axiomatic-deductivist
systems
but
a
poor
guide
for
action
in
real-world
systems
in
which
concepts
and
entities
are
without
clear
boundaries
and
continually
interact
and
overlap
In
this
world
I
would
say
we
are
better
served
with
a
methodology
that
takes
into
account
that
the
more
we
know
the
more
we
know
we
do
not
know

All
right
Let
us
admit
that
Logic
is
a
marvelous
tool
in
mathematics
and
axiomatic-deductivist
systems
but
a
poor
guide
for
action
in
real-world
systems
in
which
concepts
and
entities
are
without
clear
boundaries
and
continually
interact
and
overlap
Do
you
have
Lars
Syll
any
good
guiding
principle
for
concept
creation
and
theory
making

Lars
Syll
has
once
again
captured
well
some
fundamental
problems
with
neoclassical
economics
One
of
my
favorite
sociologists
Rose
Goldsen
often
taught
by
expanding
on
aphorisms
One
she
often
used
that
captures
Lars
argument
succinctly
is
that
too
many
sociologists
focus
on
the
characteristics
of
the
individual
instead
of
the
properties
of
the
system
I
also
wonder
about
the
fundamental
limits
of
logic
even
in
the
sciences
perhaps
most
especially
in
the
social
sciences
I
teach
in
an
education
college
with
a
colleague
who
is
knowledgeable
and
an
advocate
of
the
insights
of
Eastern
philosophies
and
religions
as
well
as
indigenous
knowledges
She
views
the
need
for
social
change
linked
to
individual
inner
change
in
mindfulness
and
a
broad
idea
of
spirituality
I
wonder
what
attention
to
spirituality
mindfulness
and
love
might
mean
to
analysis
in
economics
I’m
not
qualified
to
answer
that
but
I
have
read
a
little
about
Buddhist
economics
and
Islamic
economics
that
might
help
supplement
our
focus
on
logic

The
nature
of
economics
involves
doing
the
most
useful
and
worthwhile
thing
with
the
expenditure
of
the
least
effort
and
resources
Event
though
it
combines
labour
land
and
capital
it
is
not
directly
connected
with
human
attitudes
within
a
sociological
backing
The
measure
of
this
economics
activity
is
through
the
amounts
of
money
being
exchanged
in
the
process
The
various
parts
or
sectors
of
the
whole
arrangement
which
we
can
now
see
as
being
a
system
come
together
and
exchange
goods
and
services
with
money
Although
the
money
is
a
bit
difficult
to
use
for
analysis
due
to
its
variation
in
exact
worth
over
time
there
is
nothing
else
more
suitable
Therefore
it
enables
a
fairly
good
way
for
use
and
application
to
logical
analysis
particularly
for
simulation
of
the
whole
system
over
time
and
also
of
the
reactions
within
its
individual
and
separately
acting
parts
Much
as
it
can
be
claimed
that
economics
also
includes
the
sociological
aspects
noted
above
we
do
not
have
any
useful
ways
of
combining
the
measure
of
these
should
such
a
measure
even
be
possible
with
the
nature
and
analysis
of
business
in
trading
and
industry
Consequently
it
seems
to
me
that
we
need
to
separate
these
aspects
into
two
different
topics
and
treat
them
independently
Disregarding
the
unmeasurable
sociological
aspects
only
the
business
economics
of
the
whole
system
of
macroeconomics
is
a
necessary
and
sufficient
subject
when
we
want
to
evaluate
economic
progress
and
to
simulate
the
effects
of
taking
different
national
policies
By
the
use
of
this
resulting
and
necessary
approach
we
can
turn
what
started
as
a
complex
mixture
of
different
kinds
of
relationships
into
a
much
more
exact
process
and
better
science
The
decision
to
separate
sociology
from
macroeconomics
is
not
an
easy
one
due
to
how
the
whole
subject
has
been
introduced
to
students
some
of
whom
will
later
become
supporters
of
the
various
schools
of
thought
in
economics
However
the
need
to
take
the
approach
that
I
am
claiming
will
lead
to
more
progress
in
understanding
but
obviously
it
must
receive
a
lot
of
opposition
from
those
whose
teaching
methods
have
previously
become
firmly
established
Without
making
this
separation
there
will
always
be
confusion
and
complexity
that
spoils
and
distorts
any
real
progress
toward
the
better
understanding
and
scientific
knowledge
of
what
was
previously
described
by
most
of
the
experts
as
a
pseudo-science
instead
of
graduating
into
a
proper
one

Introduction
The
Rule
Interchange
Format
RIF
Working
Group
was
chartered
by
the
World
Wide
Web
Consortium
in
2005
to
create
a
standard
for
exchanging
rules
among
rule
systems
in
particular
among
Web
rule
engines
RIF
focused
on
exchange
rather
than
trying
to
develop
a
single
one-fits-all
rule
language
because
in
contrast
to
other
Semantic
Web
standards
such
as
RDF
OWL
and
SPARQL
it
was
immediately
clear
that
a
single
language
would
not
satisfy
the
needs
of
many
popular
paradigms
for
using
rules
in
knowledge
representation
and
business
modeling
But
even
rule
exchange
alone
was
recognized
as
a
daunting
task
Known
rule
systems
fall
into
three
broad
categories
first-order
logic-programming
and
action
rules
These
paradigms
share
little
in
the
way
of
syntax
and
semantics
Moreover
there
are
large
differences
between
systems
even
within
the
same
paradigm
Given
this
diversity
what
is
the
most
useful
notion
of
rule
exchange
The
approach
taken
by
the
Working
Group
was
to
design
a
family
of
languages
called
dialects
with
rigorously
specified
syntax
and
semantics
The
family
of
RIF
dialects
is
intended
to
be
uniform
and
extensible
RIF
uniformity
means
that
dialects
are
expected
to
share
as
much
as
possible
of
the
existing
syntactic
and
semantic
apparatus
Extensibility
here
means
that
it
should
be
possible
for
motivated
experts
to
define
a
new
RIF
dialect
as
a
syntactic
extension
to
an
existing
RIF
dialect
with
new
elements
corresponding
to
desired
additional
functionality
These
new
RIF
dialects
would
be
non-standard
when
defined
but
might
eventually
become
standards
Because
of
the
emphasis
on
rigor
the
word
format
in
the
name
of
RIF
is
somewhat
of
an
understatement
RIF
in
fact
provides
more
than
just
a
format
However
the
concept
of
format
is
essential
to
the
way
RIF
is
intended
to
be
used
Ultimately
the
medium
of
exchange
between
different
rule
systems
is
XML
a
format
for
data
exchange
Central
to
the
idea
behind
rule
exchange
through
RIF
is
that
different
systems
will
provide
syntactic
mappings
from
their
native
languages
to
RIF
dialects
and
back
These
mappings
are
required
to
be
semantics-preserving
and
thus
rule
sets
can
be
communicated
from
one
system
to
another
provided
that
the
systems
can
talk
through
a
suitable
dialect
which
they
both
support
2
RIF
Dialects
The
RIF
Working
Group
has
focused
on
two
kinds
of
dialects
logic-based
dialects
and
dialects
for
rules
with
actions
Generally
logic-based
dialects
include
languages
that
employ
some
kind
of
logic
such
as
first-order
logic
often
restricted
to
Horn
logic
or
non-first-order
logics
underlying
the
various
logic
programming
languages
e.g
logic
programming
under
the
well-founded
or
stable
semantics
The
rules-with-actions
dialects
include
production
rule
systems
such
as
Jess
Drools
and
JRules
as
well
as
reactive
or
event-condition-action
rules
such
as
Reaction
RuleML
and
XChange
Due
to
the
limited
resources
of
the
RIF
Working
Group
it
defined
only
two
logic
dialects
the
Basic
Logic
Dialect
RIF-BLD
and
a
subset
the
RIF
Core
Dialect
shared
with
RIF-PRD
the
Production
Rule
Dialect
RIF-PRD
is
the
only
rules-with-actions
dialect
defined
by
the
group
Other
dialects
are
expected
to
be
defined
by
the
various
user
communities
Present
and
future
RIF
dialects
are
expected
to
share
datatypes
built-in
functions
and
built-in
predicates
as
defined
by
RIF
Datatypes
and
Built-Ins
RIF-DTB
In
particular
the
current
dialects
RIF-BLD
RIF-Core
and
RIF-PRD
all
share
the
foundations
of
RIF-DTB

RIF
Framework
for
Logic
Dialects
The
RIF
Working
Group
spent
almost
four
years
on
developing
the
above
three
dialects
and
this
begs
a
question
If
dialect
development
is
so
time
consuming
who
will
donate
the
necessary
resources
for
the
next
round
of
development
and
who
will
ensure
the
uniformity
of
community-developed
dialects
once
the
RIF
Working
Group
disbands
The
Working
Group
partially
addressed
these
questions
by
also
developing
an
extensibility
framework
called
the
Framework
for
Logic
Dialects
or
RIF-FLD
A
comparable
framework
for
rules
with
actions
might
be
developed
later
Developing
RIF-FLD
as
a
framework
turned
out
to
be
feasible
because
despite
the
diversity
of
logical
theories
underlying
the
different
logic
rule
systems
they
share
much
of
the
same
syntactic
and
semantic
machinery
Moreover
the
ways
to
combine
the
different
pieces
of
that
machinery
in
order
to
create
those
logic
systems
are
well
studied
However
the
RIF-FLD
specification
is
unique
in
that
it
digests
much
of
this
knowledge
presents
it
in
a
coherent
form
and
uses
XML
even
on
the
framework
level
RIF-FLD
is
a
very
general
logic
language
that
includes
a
great
deal
of
commonly
used
syntactic
and
semantic
apparatus
however
it
purposely
leaves
certain
parameters
unspecified
to
enable
designers
of
concrete
dialects
to
fill
in
the
necessary
details
For
instance
RIF-FLD
provides
machinery
to
tweak
the
rules
of
syntax
through
the
notion
of
signatures
It
also
specifies
certain
semantic
notions
such
as
models
and
logical
entailment
but
it
leaves
certain
other
options
open
for
instance
which
exact
models
are
to
be
used
for
entailment
A
dialect
designer
can
then
define
the
syntax
of
a
dialect
by
specializing
it
from
the
syntax
of
RIF-FLD
and
the
semantics
by
specializing
it
from
the
semantics
of
RIF-FLD
While
doing
so
the
designer
will
make
choices
by
selecting
from
the
options
provided
by
RIF-FLD
but
he
or
she
will
not
have
to
repeat
the
definitions
of
formulas
datatypes
models
entailment
and
so
on
This
approach
is
illustrated
using
the
RIF-BLD
dialect
This
dialect
is
specified
in
two
ways
both
normative
directly
by
spelling
out
all
the
definitions
which
takes
about
40
dense
pages
and
by
specialization
from
RIF-FLD
just
about
5
pages
Any
discrepancy
between
the
two
specifications
is
to
be
treated
as
a
bug
that
must
be
clarified
and
corrected
This
dual
specification
of
RIF-BLD
is
also
intended
to
serve
as
an
example
of
dialect
design
by
specialization
from
the
RIF
framework
the
preferred
mode
of
specification
for
various
future
logic
dialects
The
RIF
framework
is
not
a
monument
that
is
cut
in
stone
and
is
likely
to
see
several
extensions
in
the
future
One
as
we
already
mentioned
might
be
to
cover
the
paradigm
of
actions
and
reactive
rules
4
RDF
and
OWL
Compatibility
Recognizing
that
RIF
rules
should
be
able
to
interface
with
RDF
and
OWL
ontologies
the
RIF
Working
Group
has
also
defined
the
necessary
concepts
to
ensure
compatibility
of
RIF
with
RDF
and
OWL
RIF
RDF
and
OWL
are
exchange
languages
with
dissimilar
syntaxes
and
semantics
How
then
should
RIF
rules
refer
to
RDF
and
OWL
facts
and
what
is
the
logical
meaning
of
the
overall
language
RIF-RDF
and
OWL
Compatibility
defines
just
that
The
basic
idea
is
that
RIF
uses
its
frame
syntax
to
communicate
with
RDF/OWL
These
frames
are
mapped
onto
RDF
triples
and
a
joint
semantics
is
defined
for
the
combination

A
General
Survey
of
the
RIF
Documents
Besides
this
Overview
the
RIF
Working
Group
has
produced
twelve
documents
six
of
which
have
become
W

Recommendations
The
following
general
survey
can
help
the
reader
to
navigate
these
documents
RIF
Primer
The
Primer
is
a
self-contained
informal
introduction
to
RIF
developing
simple
rule
examples
over
movie
data
RIF-BLD
The
Basic
Logic
Dialect
This
is
one
of
the
two
major
dialects
and
the
main
logic-based
dialect
developed
by
the
group
Technically
this
dialect
corresponds
to
Horn
logic
with
various
syntactic
and
semantic
extensions
The
main
syntactic
extensions
include
the
frame
syntax
and
predicates
with
named
arguments
The
main
semantic
extensions
include
datatypes
and
externally
defined
predicates
Although
this
dialect
is
not
expressive
enough
for
many
applications
of
rules
it
covers
many
existing
rule
systems
and
development
of
such
a
dialect
was
necessary
as
a
starting
point
for
future
more
expressive
dialects
This
future
activity
is
expected
to
take
place
within
the
RIF
extensibility
framework
RIF-FLD
RIF-PRD
The
Production
Rule
Dialect
This
is
the
other
major
dialect
developed
by
the
group
capturing
the
main
aspects
of
various
production
rule
systems
Serious
industrial
interest
in
production
rule
technology
has
been
demonstrated
by
major
players
Production
rules
as
they
are
currently
practiced
in
main-stream
systems
like
Jess
or
JRules
are
defined
using
ad
hoc
computational
mechanisms
which
are
not
based
on
a
logic
For
this
reason
RIF-PRD
is
not
part
of
the
suite
of
logical
RIF
dialects
and
stands
apart
from
them
However
significant
effort
has
been
extended
to
ensure
as
much
sharing
with
the
other
dialects
as
possible
This
sharing
was
the
main
reason
for
the
development
of
the
RIF
Core
dialect
RIF-Core
The
Core
Dialect
This
dialect
is
a
subset
of
both
RIF-BLD
and
RIF-PRD
based
on
RIF-DTB
1
0
thus
enabling
limited
rule
exchange
between
logic
rule
dialects
and
production
rules
RIF-Core
corresponds
to
Horn
logic
without
function
symbols
often
called
Datalog
with
a
number
of
extensions
to
support
features
such
as
objects
and
frames
as
in
F-logic
internationalized
resource
identifiers
for
concepts
and
XML
Schema
datatypes
RIF-FLD
The
Framework
for
Logic
Dialects
RIF-FLD
is
not
a
dialect
in
its
own
right
but
rather
a
general
logical
extensibility
framework
It
was
introduced
in
order
to
drastically
lower
the
amount
of
effort
needed
to
define
and
verify
new
logic
dialects
that
extend
the
capabilities
of
RIF-BLD
RIF-RDF
OWL
RDF
and
OWL
Compatibility
Rules
interchanged
via
RIF
may
depend
on
or
be
used
in
combination
with
RDF
data
and
RDF
Schema
or
OWL
ontologies
This
document
enables
interoperability
between
RIF
and
these
other
Semantic
Web
standards
It
defines
the
syntax
and
semantics
of
combined
RIF
RDF
and
RIF
OWL
2
languages
RIF-DTB
Datatypes
and
Built-ins
Rules
often
refer
to
built-ins
e.g
arithmetics
string
manipulation
and
datatypes
e.g
integers
strings
Booleans
To
enable
semantics-preserving
exchange
of
such
rules
it
is
necessary
that
most
commonly
used
datatypes
and
built-in
functions
and
predicates
are
identified
and
their
semantics
are
defined
precisely
This
purpose
is
served
by
the
RIF-DTB
document
RIF
XML-Data
RIF
Combination
with
XML
Data
Rules
should
be
combinable
with
XML
data
sources
This
document
specifies
how
such
combinations
can
be
done
RIF-OWLRL
OWL
2
RL
in
RIF
OWL
2
RL
is
an
OWL
2
subset
defined
via
a
partial
axiomatization
of
the
OWL
2
RDF-based
semantics
in
the
form
of
implications
That
definition
can
be
used
as
the
basis
for
a
rule-based
implementation
as
shown
in
this
document
using
RIF
RIF
in
RDF
Although
the
standard
exchange
syntax
for
RIF
is
XML
as
defined
in
the
dialect
specifications
it
is
possible
to
map
this
XML
to
RDF
graphs
so
that
RDF
systems
can
more
easily
store
and
process
RIF
documents
Since
RDF
is
compatible
with
RIF
frames
see
RIF
RDF
and
OWL
Compatibility
this
mapping
also
provides
an
interoperable
way
to
write
RIF
rules
that
process
RIF
documents
RIF-UCR
Use
Cases
and
Requirements
One
of
the
first
tasks
of
the
RIF
Working
Group
was
to
identify
classes
of
applications
that
the
RIF
suite
of
dialects
should
be
able
to
address
and
use
that
to
derive
requirements
to
RIF
To
a
large
extent
the
design
of
RIF
dialects
was
driven
by
the
requirements
found
in
the
RIF-UCR
document
RIF-Test
Test
Cases
This
document
is
primarily
of
concern
to
RIF
implementers
It
includes
the
description
of
test
cases
both
positive
and
negative
that
can
be
used
in
order
to
give
an
indication
of
whether
a
particular
implementation
of
a
RIF
dialect
is
compliant
with
the
specifications
There
is
a
companion
repository
of
the
source
code
for
the
various
test
cases

My
economics
program
had
a
class
that
transitions
or
introduces
to
proofs
with
books
like
Bridge
to
Abstract
Mathematics
Reading
Writing

at

or
A

these
I
mean
Stephen

It
begins
with
an
elementary
but
thorough
overview
of
mathematical
logic

first
order

treatment
extends

offer
instruction
in
a
variety
of
techniques
model
theory
truth
tables
Hilbert-type
proof
theory
and
proof
theory
handled
through
derived
rules
The
second
part
supplements
the
previously
discussed
material
and
introduces
some
of
the
newer
ideas
and
the
more
profound
results
of
twentieth-century
logical
research
Subsequent
chapters
explore
the
study
of
formal
number
theory
with
surveys
of
the
famous
incompleteness
and
undecidability
results
of
Godel
Church
Turing
and
others
The
emphasis
in
the
final
chapter
reverts
to
logic
with
examinations
of
Godel's
completeness
theorem
Gentzen's
theorem
Skolem's
paradox
and
nonstandard
models
of
arithmetic
and
other
theorems

I
strongly
recommend
to
cover
at
least
some
basics
of
Mathematical
Logic
The
literature
is
full
with
logical

articles
Hence
you
should
master
a

to
be
able
to
recognize
these
failures

yourself

As
pointed
out
in
the
comments
this
question
asks
two
different
questions
I
will
try
to
answer
them
separately
Question
1
To
what
extent
does
economics
use
Mathematical
Logic
Answer
while
an
extent
is
not
something
that
can
be
easily
measured
I
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
in
theoretical
part
of
economics
is
virtually
omnipresent
Consider
the
following
fact
MWG
Microceonomic
Theory
which
is
arguably
the
most
popular
and
comprehensive
graduate
text
for
microeconomic
theory
has
a
rigorous
proof
derived
from
rigorous
definitions
and
propositions
on
virtually
every
single
page
save
for
preface
practice
questions
and
reference
page
and
few
pages
here
and
there
That
is
about
900
pages
out
of
about
1000
page
book
that
rely
heavily
on
formal
mathematical
logic
In
different
sub-fields
of
economics
the
importance
of
rigorous
mathematical
proofs
can
vary
but
in
most
of
them
I
cant
think
of
any
graduate
text
that
would
not
lean
heavily
on
formal
mathematical
logic
Maybe
philosophy
of
economics
or
history
of
economic
thought
would
be
some
exceptions
and
even
there
for
example
Philosophy
of
Economics
A
Contemporary
Introduction
by
Julian
Reiss
includes
some
parts
that
are
written
in
formal
mathematical
logic
Question
2
Do
economics
degrees
require
this
referring
to
subjects
you
mention
inside
the
question
Formal
Mathematical
Logic
Answer
Generally
not
I
could
not
find
any
survey
on
this
issue
but
I
think
its
fair
to
say
majority
of
economic
degrees
do
not
have
such
courses
that
you
mentioned
as
requirement
to
graduate
and
obtain
a
degree
The
reason
for
that
is
that
if
you
are
good
at
mathematics
you
will
be
able
to
understand
and
even
construct
proofs
without
ever
sitting
in
any
course
on
formal
mathematical
logic
Any
study
of
mathematics
implicitly
also
teaches
you
formal
mathematical
logic
just
not
in
necessary
structured
or
obvious
way
As
a
matter
of
fact
these
fields
referring
to
the
courses
you
mention
are
relatively
new
subfields
of
mathematics
and
as
Michael
Greinecker
pointed
out
in
comments
Mathematicians
have
proved
theorems
long
before
these
subfields
emerged
To
see
this
you
can
just
look
at
the
beautiful
and
rigorous
proofs
in
Euclid's
Elements
that
were
drafted
thousands
of
years
ago
yet
most
of
them
still
hold
up
and
are
quite
rigorous
This
being
said
taking
formal
class
on
introduction
into
making
formal
mathematical
proofs
should
improve
your
own
proof-making
and
understanding
of
proofs
and
help
you
to
make
your
own
future
work
more
rigorous
The
question
is
whether
this
benefit
outweighs
the
opportunity
cost
of
that
lost
time
but
that
is
opinionated
question
I
won't
go
into
I
think
this
can
be
the
best
explained
by
following
analogy
This
is
like
asking
to
what
extent
economics
uses
linguistics
and
its
sub-fields
of
grammar
stylistics
etc
Well
again
linguistic
is
omnipresent
in
economics
as
most
papers
are
not
just
proofs
with
zero
text
However
is
it
necessary
to
take
academic
writing
class
or
class
in
stylistic
or
grammar
to
be
an
economist
or
to
get
an
economic
degree
Well
no
I
think
its
fair
to
say
most
science
degrees
will
have
only
optional
writing
classes
and
many
not
even
that
Many
people
will
just
learn
how
to
write
excellent
academic
works
just
by
reading
other
papers
However
at
the
same
time
any
person's
writing
would
undoubtedly
benefit
by
taking
some
academic
writing
class
where
you
are
exposed
to
stylistics
and
other
sub-fields
of
linguistics
even
if
it
is
not
required
to
ever
have
such
class

From
the
publisher
Lean
Logic
is
the
late
David
Fleming’s
masterpiece
the
product
of
more
than
thirty
years
work
and
a
testament
to
the
creative
brilliance
of
one
of
Britain’s
most
important
intellectuals
A
dictionary
unlike
any
other
it
leads
readers
through
Fleming’s
stimulating
exploration
of
fields
as
diverse
as
culture
history
science
art
logic
ethics
myth
economics
and
anthropology
being
made
up
of
four
hundred
and
four
engaging
essay-entries
covering
topics
such
as
Boredom
Community
Debt
Growth
Harmless
Lunatics
Land
Lean
Thinking
Nanotechnology
Play
Religion
Spirit
Trust
and
Utopia
The
threads
running
through
every
entry
are
Fleming’s
deft
and
original
analysis
of
how
our
present
market-based
economy
is
destroying
the
very
foundations—ecological
economic
and
cultural
on
which
it
depends
and
his
core
focus
a
compelling
grounded
vision
for
a
cohesive
society
that
might
weather
the
consequences
A
society
that
provides
a
satisfying
culturally-rich
context
for
lives
well
lived
in
an
economy
not
reliant
on
the
impossible
promise
of
eternal
economic
growth
A
society
worth
living
in
Worth
fighting
for
Worth
contributing
to
The
beauty
of
the
dictionary
format
is
that
it
allows
Fleming
to
draw
connections
without
detracting
from
his
in-depth
exploration
of
each
topic
Each
entry
carries
intriguing
links
to
other
entries
inviting
the
enchanted
reader
to
break
free
of
the
imposed
order
of
a
conventional
book
starting
where
she
will
and
following
the
links
in
the
order
of
her
choosing
In
combination
with
Fleming’s
refreshing
writing
style
and
good-natured
humor
it
also
creates
a
book
perfectly
suited
to
dipping
in
and
out
The
decades
Fleming
spent
honing
his
life’s
work
are
evident
in
the
lightness
and
mastery
with
which
Lean
Logic
draws
on
an
incredible
wealth
of
cultural
and
historical
learning—from
Whitman
to
Whitefield
Dickens
to
Daly
Kropotkin
to
Kafka
Keats
to
Kuhn
Oakeshott
to
Ostrom
Jung
to
Jensen
Machiavelli
to
Mumford
Mauss
to
Mandelbrot
Leopold
to
Lakatos
Polanyi
to
Putnam
Nietzsche
to
Næss
Keynes
to
Kumar
Scruton
to
Shiva
Thoreau
to
Toynbee
Rabelais
to
Rogers
Shakespeare
to
Schumacher
Locke
to
Lovelock
Homer
to
Homer-Dixon—in
demonstrating
that
many
of
the
principles
it
commends
have
a
track-record
of
success
long
pre-dating
our
current
society
Fleming
acknowledges
with
honesty
the
challenges
ahead
but
rather
than
inducing
despair
Lean
Logic
is
rare
in
its
ability
to
inspire
optimism
in
the
creativity
and
intelligence
of
humans
to
nurse
our
ecology
back
to
health
to
rediscover
the
importance
of
place
and
play
of
reciprocity
and
resilience
and
of
community
and
culture

As
the
Covid
19
fueled
economic
downturn
begins
to
intensify
this
winter
an
extended
study
of
the
Italian
cooperative
sector’s
historical
resilience
in
times
of
crisis
can
serve
as
a
learning
experience
for
other
countries
seeking
to
create
policies
that
foster
more
stable
economies
with
job
security
care
for
marginalized
communities
and
adequate
counter-cyclical
policies
Particularly
the
Italian
cooperative
sector’s
contributions
to
three
aspects
should
be
noted
in
closing
Firstly
the
innovative
phenomenon
of
cooperative
enterprises
has
contributed
to
social
inclusion
of
immigrant
communities
the
activation
of
youth
the
unemployed
and
people
with
disabilities
a
true
compensation
for
both
a
market
and
state
failure
Secondly
they
have
contributed
to
a
reduction
in
income
and
wealth
inequalities
at
a
time
when
the
issue
of
inequality
is
of
global
significance
Thirdly
the
Italian
cooperative
movement
has
helped
local
communities
revitalize
in
the
face
of
demographic
shifts
and
rendered
them
more
resilient
to
the
ravages
of
globalization
Each
of
these
in
their
own
right
is
a
remarkable
achievement

Logic
n
The
art
of
thinking
and
reasoning
in
strict
accordance
with
the
limitations
and
incapacities
of
the
human
misunderstanding
The
basic
of
logic
is
the
syllogism
consisting
of
a
major
and
a
minor
premise
and
a
conclusion
thus
Major
Premise
Sixty
men
can
do
a
piece
of
work
sixty
times
as
quickly
as
one
man
Minor
Premise
One
man
can
dig
a
post-hole
in
sixty
seconds
Therefore
Conclusion
Sixty
men
can
dig
a
post-hole
in
one
second
This
may
be
called
syllogism
arithmetical
in
which
by
combining
logic
and
mathematics
we
obtain
a
double
certainty
and
are
twice
blessed
Ambrose
Bierce
The
Unabridged
Devil’s
Dictionary
In
mainstream
economics
both
logic
and
mathematics
are
used
extensively
And
most
mainstream
economists
sure
look
upon
themselves
as
twice
blessed
Is
there
any
scientific
ground
for
that
blessedness
None
whatsoever
If
scientific
progress
in
economics
lies
in
our
ability
to
tell
better
and
better
stories
one
would
of
course
expect
economics
journals
being
filled
with
articles
supporting
the
stories
with
empirical
evidence
confirming
the
predictions
However
the
journals
still
show
a
striking
and
embarrassing
paucity
of
empirical
studies
that
try
to
substantiate
these
predictive
claims
Equally
amazing
is
how
little
one
has
to
say
about
the
relationship
between
the
model
and
real-world
target
systems
It
is
as
though
explicit
discussion
argumentation
and
justification
on
the
subject
aren’t
considered
to
be
required
In
mathematics
the
deductive-axiomatic
method
has
worked
just
fine
But
science
is
not
mathematics
Conflating
those
two
domains
of
knowledge
has
been
one
of
the
most
fundamental
mistakes
made
in
modern
economics
Applying
it
to
real-world
open
systems
immediately
proves
it
to
be
excessively
narrow
and
hopelessly
irrelevant
Both
the
confirmatory
and
explanatory
ilk
of
hypothetico-deductive
reasoning
fails
since
there
is
no
way
you
can
relevantly
analyse
confirmation
or
explanation
as
a
purely
logical
relation
between
hypothesis
and
evidence
or
between
law-like
rules
and
explananda
In
science
we
argue
and
try
to
substantiate
our
beliefs
and
hypotheses
with
reliable
evidence
Propositional
and
predicate
deductive
logic
on
the
other
hand
is
not
about
reliability
but
the
validity
of
the
conclusions
given
that
the
premises
are
true
Deduction
and
the
inferences
that
go
with
it
is
an
example
of
explicative
reasoning
where
the
conclusions
we
make
are
already
included
in
the
premises
Deductive
inferences
are
purely
analytical
and
it
is
this
truth-preserving
nature
of
deduction
that
makes
it
different
from
all
other
kinds
of
reasoning
But
it
is
also
its
limitation
since
truth
in
the
deductive
context
does
not
refer
to
a
real-world
ontology
only
relating
propositions
as
true
or
false
within
a
formal-logic
system
and
as
an
argument
scheme
is
totally
non-ampliative
the
output
of
the
analysis
is
nothing
else
than
the
input
If
the
ultimate
criterion
of
success
of
a
model
is
to
what
extent
it
predicts
and
coheres
with
parts
of
reality
modern
mainstream
economics
seems
to
be
a
hopeless
misallocation
of
scientific
resources
To
focus
scientific
endeavours
on
proving
things
in
mathematical
models
is
a
gross
misapprehension
of
what
an
economic
theory
ought
to
be
about
Deductivist
models
and
methods
disconnected
from
reality
are
not
relevant
to
predict
explain
or
understand
real-world
economies
In
science
we
standardly
use
a
logically
non-valid
inference
the
fallacy
of
affirming
the
consequent
of
the
following
form
1
p
q
2
q
p
or
in
instantiated
form
1
x
Gx
Px
2
Pa
Ga
Although
logically
invalid
it
is
nonetheless
as
already
Charles
S
Peirce
argued
more
than
a
century
ago
a
kind
of
inference
abduction
that
may
be
factually
strongly
warranted
and
truth-producing
64800990
Following
the
general
pattern
Evidence
Explanation
Inference
we
infer
something
based
on
what
would
be
the
best
explanation
given
the
law-like
rule
premise
1
and
an
observation
premise
2
The
truth
of
the
conclusion
explanation
is
nothing
that
is
logically
given
but
something
we
have
to
justify
argue
for
and
test
in
different
ways
to
possibly
establish
with
any
certainty
or
degree
And
as
always
when
we
deal
with
explanations
what
is
considered
best
is
relative
to
what
we
know
of
the
world
In
the
real
world
all
evidence
has
an
irreducible
holistic
aspect
We
never
conclude
that
evidence
follows
from
a
hypothesis
simpliciter
but
always
given
some
more
or
less
explicitly
stated
contextual
background
assumptions
All
non-deductive
inferences
and
explanations
are
necessarily
context-dependent
If
we
extend
the
abductive
scheme
to
incorporate
the
demand
that
the
explanation
has
to
be
the
best
among
a
set
of
plausible
competing/rival/contrasting
potential
and
satisfactory
explanations
we
have
what
is
nowadays
usually
referred
to
as
inference
to
the
best
explanation
In
inference
to
the
best
explanation
we
start
with
a
body
of
purported
data/facts/evidence
and
search
for
explanations
that
can
account
for
these
data/facts/evidence
Having
the
best
explanation
means
that
you
given
the
context-dependent
background
assumptions
have
a
satisfactory
explanation
that
can
explain
the
fact/evidence
better
than
any
other
competing
explanation
and
so
it
is
reasonable
to
consider/believe
the
hypothesis
to
be
true
Even
if
we
inevitably
do
not
have
deductive
certainty
our
reasoning
gives
us
a
license
to
consider
our
belief
in
the
hypothesis
as
reasonable
Accepting
a
hypothesis
means
that
you
believe
it
does
explain
the
available
evidence
better
than
any
other
competing
hypothesis
Knowing
that
we
after
having
earnestly
considered
and
analysed
the
other
available
potential
explanations
have
been
able
to
eliminate
the
competing
potential
explanations
warrants
and
enhances
the
confidence
we
have
that
our
preferred
explanation
is
the
best
explanation
i
e
the
explanation
that
provides
us
given
it
is
true
with
the
greatest
understanding
This
of
course
does
not
in
any
way
mean
that
we
cannot
be
wrong
Of
course
we
can
Inferences
to
the
best
explanation
are
fallible
inferences
since
the
premises
do
not
logically
entail
the
conclusion
so
from
a
logical
point
of
view
inference
to
the
best
explanation
is
a
weak
mode
of
inference
But
if
the
arguments
put
forward
are
strong
enough
they
can
be
warranted
and
give
us
justified
true
belief
and
hence
knowledge
even
though
they
are
fallible
inferences
As
scientists
we
sometimes
much
like
Sherlock
Holmes
and
other
detectives
that
use
inference
to
the
best
explanation
reasoning
experience
disillusion
We
thought
that
we
had
reached
a
strong
conclusion
by
ruling
out
the
alternatives
in
the
set
of
contrasting
explanations
But
what
we
thought
was
true

According
to
Prof
Syll
the
best
explanation
means
that
you…have
a
satisfactory
explanation
that
can
explain
the
fact/evidence
better
than
any
other
competing
explanation
Sadly
this
is
merely
an
uninteresting
definition
or
tautology
or
circular
reasoning
Of
course
we
prefer
the
best
theory
rather
than
worse
theories
The
difficult
issues
concern
data
and
the
criteria
for
deciding
what
is
best
Prof
Syll
gives
no
suggestions
on
these
matters
Simplicity
Comprehensibility
Empirical
Adequacy
Cognitive
Fit
Explanatory
power
Minimal
changes
in
scientific
belief
compared
with
previously
held
theory
Intellectual
pedigree
Aesthetic
beauty
Consistency
with
political
philosophical
and
religious
beliefs
Anti-racism
Wokeness
How
should
we
measure
and
weight
such
criteria
And
who
should
decide
such
matters
Most
scientists
prefer
inductive
methods
e.g
maximum
likelihood
given
the
available
data

Explanations
based
on
deductive
reasoning
as
Lars
has
voluminously
explained
aren’t
particularly
helpful
because
they
draw
on
assumptions
which
permit
coherence
rigour
and
tractability
rather
than
relevance
to
the
real
world
Explanations
based
on
abduction
may
be
more
useful
but
if
the
aim
is
prediction
then
an
assumption
that
the
system
of
interest
is
homogenous
across
time
must
be
made
Otherwise
abduction
is
as
useful
as
deductive
reasoning

I
think
you
misread
me
here
I
certainly
have
no
problem
at
all
with
mathematics
or
logic
per
se
That’s
not
what
I
am
criticising
Far
from
it
But
to
insist
on
always
applying
mathematical-formalistic
models
and
theories
as
is
standard
in
mainstream
economics
and
not
seriously
taking
into
consideration
if
they
are
suited
for
understanding
and
explaining
things
in
the
intended
real-world
target
system
is
not
an
acceptable
scientific
procedure
And
further
even
where
they
are
applicable
the
problem
is
that
they
usually
do
not
take
us
very
far
and
that’s
why
I
argue
that
it
would
be
better
to
go
for
abduction
rather
than
deduction
when
you
want
to
make
inferences
about
systems
without
the
needed
closures
that
the
deductive
kind
of
inferences
presuppose

As
a
mathematician
I
just
don’t
see
how
this
helps
Taking
Lars
last
paragraph
isn’t
logic
relevant
to
science
And
in
so
far
as
science
is
interested
in
mathematical
structures
such
as
numbers
isn’t
mathematics
essential
to
science
In
terms
of
the
starting
quote
I
don’t
see
any
problem
Isn’t
the
notion
of
a
syllogism
essential
to
science
Suppose
we
know
that
p
implies
q
and
that
q
is
consistent
with
evidence
e
Then
we
can
conclude
that
p
is
also
consistent
with
evidence
e
Isn’t
this
how
science
works
As
distinct
from
applying
the
results
of
science
as
if
they
were
facts
which
is
a
different
subject
This
is
very
like
Lars
notion
of
abduction
but
is
strictly
logical
for
any
strictly
logical
interpretation
of
implies
and
evidence
Lars
wishes
to
go
beyond
abduction
to
inference
to
the
best
explanation
This
could
also
be
made
logical
by
having
a
logical
definition
of
best
It
seems
to
me
that
neoclassical
economics
could
be
reformulated
in
a
way
that
meets
Lars
requirements
and
is
also
logical
and
mathematical
it
is
just
that
Lars
and
I
might
not
accept
their
notion
of
best
It
seems
to
me
that
Lars
draws
our
attention
to
an
area
that
needs
sorting
out
if
economics
and
much
else
is
to
make
progress
but
I
just
don’t
get
how
his
explanations
help
My
own
explanation
for
the
malaise
in
economics
is
that
economists
have
tended
not
to
understand
how
science
works
at
its
best
and
have
instead
taken
their
lead
from
some
inadequate
understanding
of
science
and
hence
a
misuse
of
logic
and
a
misinterpretation
of
mathematical
results
This
seems
a
better
explanation
to
me
than
Lars
view
is
that
logic
and
maths
per
se
are
to
blame
But
maybe
the
teaching
of
maths
and
logic
are
at
fault

I
began
my
doctoral
research
into
the
limitations
of
formalist
approaches
to
rationality
by
examining
Imre
Lakatos
Proofs
and
Refutations
where
he
demonstrates
that
mathematical
proofs
are
just
as
much
subject
to
ceteris
paribus
clauses
as
science
More
recently
George
Lakoff’s
Where
Does
Mathematics
Come
From
is
a
more
broad
ranging
exploration
of
the
metaphoric
structuring
of
mathematics
and
the
implications
that
has
for
mathematical
reasoning
The
biggest
difference
between
mathematics
and
science
is
the
centrality
of
causal
reasoning
in
the
latter
not
the
limits
of
deductive
reasoning

Philosophy
of
Economics
consists
of
inquiries
concerning
a
rational
choice
b
the
appraisal
of
economic
outcomes
institutions
and
processes
and
c
the
ontology
of
economic
phenomena
and
the
possibilities
of
acquiring
knowledge
of
them
Although
these
inquiries
overlap
in
many
ways
it
is
useful
to
divide
philosophy
of
economics
in
this
way
into
three
subject
matters
which
can
be
regarded
respectively
as
branches
of
action
theory
ethics
or
normative
social
and
political
philosophy
and
philosophy
of
science
Economic
theories
of
rationality
welfare
and
social
choice
defend
substantive
philosophical
theses
often
informed
by
relevant
philosophical
literature
and
of
evident
interest
to
those
interested
in
action
theory
philosophical
psychology
and
social
and
political
philosophy
Economics
is
of
particular
interest
to
those
interested
in
epistemology
and
philosophy
of
science
both
because
of
its
detailed
peculiarities
and
because
it
possesses
many
of
the
overt
features
of
the
natural
sciences
while
its
object
consists
of
social
phenomena

Introduction
What
is
Economics
Both
the
definition
and
the
precise
domain
of
economics
are
subjects
of
controversy
within
philosophy
of
economics
At
first
glance
the
difficulties
in
defining
economics
may
not
appear
serious
Economics
is
after
all
concerned
with
aspects
of
the
production
exchange
distribution
and
consumption
of
commodities
and
services
But
this
claim
and
the
terms
it
contains
are
vague
and
it
is
arguable
that
economics
is
relevant
to
a
great
deal
more
It
helps
to
approach
the
question
What
is
economics
historically
before
turning
to
comments
on
contemporary
features
of
the
discipline

1
The
emergence
of
economics
and
of
economies
Philosophical
reflection
on
economics
is
ancient
but
the
conception
of
the
economy
as
a
distinct
object
of
study
dates
back
only
to
the
18
th
century
Aristotle
addresses
some
problems
that
most
would
recognize
as
pertaining
to
economics
mainly
as
problems
concerning
how
to
manage
a
household
Scholastic
philosophers
addressed
ethical
questions
concerning
economic
behavior
and
they
condemned
usury
that
is
the
taking
of
interest
on
money
With
the
increasing
importance
of
trade
and
of
nation-states
in
the
early
modern
period
mercantilist
philosophers
and
pamphleteers
were
largely
concerned
with
the
balance
of
trade
and
the
regulation
of
the
currency
There
was
an
increasing
recognition
of
the
complexities
of
the
financial
management
of
the
state
and
of
the
possibility
that
the
way
that
the
state
taxed
and
acted
influenced
the
production
of
wealth
In
the
early
modern
period
those
who
reflected
on
the
sources
of
a
country’s
wealth
recognized
that
the
annual
harvest
the
quantities
of
goods
manufactured
and
the
products
of
mines
and
fisheries
depend
on
facts
about
nature
individual
labor
and
enterprise
tools
and
what
we
would
call
capital
goods
and
state
and
social
regulations
Trade
also
seemed
advantageous
at
least
if
the
terms
were
good
enough
It
took
no
conceptual
leap
to
recognize
that
manufacturing
and
farming
could
be
improved
and
that
some
taxes
and
tariffs
might
be
less
harmful
to
productive
activities
than
others
But
to
formulate
the
idea
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
economy
with
regularities
that
can
be
investigated
requires
a
bold
further
step
In
order
for
there
to
be
an
object
of
inquiry
there
must
be
regularities
in
production
and
exchange
and
for
the
inquiry
to
be
non-trivial
these
regularities
must
go
beyond
what
is
obvious
to
the
producers
consumers
and
exchangers
themselves
Only
in
the
eighteenth
century
most
clearly
illustrated
by
the
work
of
Cantillon
the
physiocrats
David
Hume
and
especially
Adam
Smith
see
the
entry
on
Smith’s
moral
and
political
philosophy
does
one
find
the
idea
that
there
are
laws
to
be
discovered
that
govern
the
complex
set
of
interactions
that
produce
and
distribute
consumption
goods
and
the
resources
and
tools
that
produce
them
Backhouse
2002
Crucial
to
the
possibility
of
a
social
object
of
scientific
inquiry
is
the
idea
of
tracing
out
the
unintended
consequences
of
the
intentional
actions
of
individuals
Thus
for
example
Hume
traces
the
rise
in
prices
and
the
temporary
increase
in
economic
activity
that
follow
an
increase
in
currency
to
the
perceptions
and
actions
of
individuals
who
first
spend
the
additional
currency
1752
In
spending
their
additional
gold
imported
from
abroad
traders
do
not
intend
to
increase
the
price
level
But
that
is
what
they
do
nevertheless
Adam
Smith
expands
and
perfects
this
insight
and
offers
a
systematic
Inquiry
into
the
Nature
and
Causes
of
the
Wealth
of
Nations

his
account
of
the
demise
of
feudalism

Book

Ch

to
his
famous
discussion
of
the
invisible
hand
Smith
emphasizes
unintended
consequences
H]e
intends
only
his
own
gain
and
he
is
in
this
as
in
many
other
cases
led
by
an
invisible
hand
to
promote
an
end
which
was
no
part
of
his
intention
Nor
is
it
always
the
worse
for
the
society
that
it
was
no
part
of
it
By
pursuing
his
own
interest
he
frequently
promotes
that
of
the
society
more
effectually
than
when
he
really
intends
to
promote
it
1776

The
existence
of
regularities
which
are
the
unintended
consequences
of
individual
choices
gives
rise
to
an
object
of
scientific
investigation
One
can
distinguish
the
domain
of
economics
from
the
domain
of
other
social
scientific
inquiries
either
by
specifying
some
set
of
causal
factors
or
by
specifying
some
range
of
phenomena
The
phenomena
with
which
economists
are
concerned
are
production
consumption
distribution
and
exchange—particularly
via
markets
But
since
so
many
different
causal
factors
are
relevant
to
these
including
the
laws
of
thermodynamics
metallurgy
geography
and
social
norms
even
the
laws
governing
digestion
economics
cannot
be
distinguished
from
other
inquiries
only
by
the
phenomena
it
studies
Some
reference
to
a
set
of
central
causal
factors
is
needed
Thus
for
example
John
Stuart
Mill
maintained
that
Political
economy
is
concerned
with
such
of
the
phenomena
of
the
social
state
as
take
place
in
consequence
of
the
pursuit
of
wealth
It
makes
entire
abstraction
of
every
other
human
passion
or
motive
except
those
which
may
be
regarded
as
perpetually
antagonising
principles
to
the
desire
of
wealth
namely
aversion
to
labour
and
desire
of
the
present
enjoyment
of
costly
indulgences
1843
Book
VI
Chapter

Section

In
Mill’s
view
economics
is
mainly
concerned
with
the
consequences
of
individual
pursuit
of
tangible
wealth
though
it
takes
some
account
of
less
significant
motives
such
as
aversion
to
labor
Mill
takes
it
for
granted
that
individuals
act
rationally
in
their
pursuit
of
wealth
and
luxury
and
avoidance
of
labor
rather
than
in
a
disjointed
or
erratic
way
but
he
has
no
theory
of
consumption
or
explicit
theory
of
rational
economic
choice
and
his
theory
of
resource
allocation
is
rather
thin
These
gaps
were
gradually
filled
during
the
so-called
neoclassical
or
marginalist
revolution
which
linked
choice
of
some
object
of
consumption
and
its
price
not
to
its
total
utility
but
to
its
marginal
utility
For
example
water
is
obviously
extremely
useful
but
in
much
of
the
world
it
is
plentiful
enough
that
another
glass
more
or
less
matters
little
to
an
agent
So
water
is
cheap
Early
neoclassical
economists
such
as
William
Stanley
Jevons
held
that
agents
make
consumption
choices
so
as
to
maximize
their
own
happiness
1871
This
implies
that
they
distribute
their
expenditures
so
that
a
dollar’s
worth
of
water
or
porridge
or
upholstery
makes
the
same
contribution
to
their
happiness
The
marginal
utility
of
a
dollar’s
worth
of
each
good
is
the
same
In
the
Twentieth
Century
economists
stripped
this
theory
of
its
hedonistic
clothing
Pareto
1909
Hicks
and
Allen
1934
Rather
than
supposing
that
all
consumption
choices
can
be
ranked
by
how
much
they
promote
an
agent’s
happiness
economists
focused
on
the
ranking
itself
All
that
they
suppose
concerning
evaluations
is
that
agents
are
able
consistently
to
rank
the
alternatives
they
face
This
is
equivalent
to
supposing
first
that
rankings
are
complete
that
is
for
any
two
alternatives
x
and
y
that
the
agent
considers
either
the
agent
ranks
x
above
y
prefers
x
to
y
or
the
agent
prefers
y
to
x
or
the
agent
is
indifferent
Second
economists
suppose
that
agent’s
rankings
of
alternatives
preferences
are
transitive
To
say
that
an
agent’s
preferences
are
transitive
is
to
claim
that
if
the
agent
prefers
x
to
y
and
y
to
z
then
the
agent
prefers
x
to
z
with
similar
claims
concerning
indifference
and
combinations
of
indifference
and
preference
Though
there
are
further
technical
conditions
to
extend
the
theory
to
infinite
sets
of
alternatives
and
to
capture
further
plausible
rationality
conditions
concerning
gambles
economists
generally
subscribe
to
a
view
of
rational
agents
as
at
least
possessing
complete
and
transitive
preferences
and
as
choosing
among
the
feasible
alternatives
whichever
they
most
prefer
In
the
theory
of
revealed
preference
economists
have
attempted
unsuccessfully
to
eliminate
all
reference
to
subjective
preference
or
to
define
preference
in
terms
of
choices

In
clarifying
the
view
of
rationality
that
characterizes
economic
agents
economists
have
for
the
most
part
continued
to
distinguish
economics
from
other
social
inquiries
by
the
content
of
the
motives
or
preferences
with
which
it
is
concerned
So
even
though
people
may
seek
happiness
through
asceticism
or
they
may
rationally
prefer
to
sacrifice
all
their
worldly
goods
to
a
political
cause
economists
have
supposed
that
such
preferences
are
rare
and
unimportant
to
economics
Economists
are
concerned
with
the
phenomena
deriving
from
rationality
coupled
with
a
desire
for
wealth
and
for
larger
bundles
of
goods
and
services
Economists
have
flirted
with
a
less
substantive
characterization
of
individual
motivation
and
with
a
more
expansive
view
of
the
domain
of
economics
In
his
influential
monograph
An
Essay
on
the
Nature
and
Significance
of
Economic
Science
Lionel
Robbins
defined
economics
as
the
science
which
studies
human
behavior
as
a
relationship
between
ends
and
scarce
means
which
have
alternative
uses
1932
p
15
According
to
Robbins
economics
is
not
concerned
with
production
exchange
distribution
or
consumption
as
such
It
is
instead
concerned
with
an
aspect
of
all
human
action
Robbins
definition
helps
one
to
understand
efforts
to
apply
economic
concepts
models
and
techniques
to
other
subject
matters
such
as
the
analysis
of
voting
behavior
and
legislation
even
as
economics
maintains
its
connection
to
a
traditional
domain

Contemporary
economics
and
its
several
schools
Contemporary
economics
is
diverse
There
are
many
schools
and
many
branches
Even
so-called
orthodox
or
mainstream
economics
has
many
variants
Some
mainstream
economics
is
highly
theoretical
though
most
of
it
is
applied
and
relies
on
rudimentary
theory
Theoretical
and
applied
work
can
be
distinguished
as
microeconomics
or
macroeconomics
There
is
also
a
third
branch
econometrics
which
is
devoted
to
the
empirical
estimation
elaboration
and
to
some
extent
testing
of
microeconomic
and
macroeconomic
models
but
see
Summers
1991
and
Hoover
1994
Microeconomics
focuses
on
relations
among
individuals
with
firms
and
households
frequently
counting
as
honorary
individuals
and
little
said
about
the
idiosyncrasies
of
the
demand
of
particular
individuals
Individuals
have
complete
and
transitive
preferences
that
govern
their
choices
Consumers
prefer
more
commodities
to
fewer
and
have
diminishing
marginal
rates
of
substitution
i
e
they
will
pay
less
for
units
of
a
commodity
when
they
already
have
lots
of
it
than
when
they
have
little
of
it
Firms
attempt
to
maximize
profits
in
the
face
of
diminishing
returns
holding
fixed
all
the
inputs
into
production
except
one
output
increases
when
there
is
more
of
the
remaining
input
but
at
a
diminishing
rate
Economists
idealize
and
suppose
that
in
competitive
markets
firms
and
individuals
cannot
influence
prices
but
economists
are
also
interested
in
strategic
interactions
in
which
the
rational
choices
of
separate
individuals
are
interdependent
Game
theory
which
is
devoted
to
the
study
of
strategic
interactions
is
of
growing
importance
in
economics
Economists
model
the
outcome
of
the
profit-maximizing
activities
of
firms
and
the
attempts
of
consumers
optimally
to
satisfy
their
preferences
as
an
equilibrium
in
which
there
is
no
excess
demand
on
any
market
What
this
means
is
that
anyone
who
wants
to
buy
anything
at
the
going
market
price
is
able
to
do
so
There
is
no
excess
demand
and
unless
a
good
is
free
there
is
no
excess
supply
Macroeconomics
grapples
with
the
relations
among
economic
aggregates
such
as
relations
between
the
money
supply
and
the
rate
of
interest
or
the
rate
of
growth
focusing
especially
on
problems
concerning
the
business
cycle
and
the
influence
of
monetary
and
fiscal
policy
on
economic
outcomes
Many
mainstream
economists
would
like
to
unify
macroeconomics
and
microeconomics
but
few
economists
are
satisfied
with
the
attempts
that
have
been
made
to
do
so
especially
via
so
called
representative
agents

Macroeconomics
is
immediately
relevant
to
economic
policy
and
hence
and
unsurprisingly
subject
to
much
more
heated
and
politically-charged
controversy
than
microeconomics
or
econometrics

macroeconomics

Branches
of
mainstream
economics
are
also
devoted
to
specific
questions
concerning
growth
finance
employment
agriculture
housing
natural
resources
international
trade
and
so
forth
Within
orthodox
economics
there
are
also
many
different
approaches
such
as
agency
theory
Jensen
and
Meckling
1976
Fama
1980
the
Chicago
school
Becker
1976
or
public
choice
theory
Brennan

Buchanan
1985
Buchanan
1975
These
address
questions
concerning
incentives
within
firms
and
families
and
the
ways
that
institutions
guide
choices
Although
mainstream
economics
is
dominant
and
demands
the
most
attention
there
are
many
other
schools
Austrian
economists
accept
orthodox
views
of
choices
and
constraints
but
they
emphasize
uncertainty
and
question
whether
one
should
regard
outcomes
as
equilibria
and
they
are
skeptical
about
the
value
of
mathematical
modeling

Six
central
methodological
problems
Although
the
different
branches
and
schools
of
economics
raise
a
wide
variety
of
epistemological
and
ontological
issues
concerning
economics
six
problems
have
been
central
to
methodological
reflection
in
this
philosophical
sense
concerning
economics
2
1
Positive
versus
normative
economics
Policy
makers
look
to
economics
to
guide
policy
and
it
seems
inevitable
that
even
the
most
esoteric
issues
in
theoretical
economics
may
bear
on
some
people’s
material
interests
The
extent
to
which
economics
bears
on
and
may
be
influenced
by
normative
concerns
raises
methodological
questions
about
the
relationships
between
a
positive
science
concerning
facts
and
a
normative
inquiry
into
values
and
what
ought
to
be
Most
economists
and
methodologists
believe
that
there
is
a
reasonably
clear
distinction
between
facts
and
values
between
what
is
and
what
ought
to
be
and
they
believe
that
most
of
economics
should
be
regarded
as
a
positive
science
that
helps
policy
makers
choose
means
to
accomplish
their
ends
though
it
does
not
bear
on
the
choice
of
ends
itself
This
view
is
questionable
for
several
reasons
Mongin
2006
Hausman
McPherson
and
Satz
2017
First
economists
have
to
interpret
and
articulate
the
incomplete
specifications
of
goals
and
constraints
provided
by
policy
makers
Machlup
1969
b
Second
economic
science
is
a
human
activity
and
like
all
human
activities
it
is
governed
by
values
Those
values
need
not
be
the
same
as
the
values
that
influence
economic
policy
but
it
is
debatable
whether
the
values
that
govern
the
activity
of
economists
can
be
sharply
distinguished
from
the
values
that
govern
policy
makers
Third
much
of
economics
is
built
around
a
normative
theory
of
rationality
One
can
question
whether
the
values
implicit
in
such
theories
are
sharply
distinguishable
from
the
values
that
govern
policies
For
example
it
may
be
difficult
to
hold
a
maximizing
view
of
individual
rationality
while
at
the
same
time
insisting
that
social
policy
should
resist
maximizing
growth
wealth
or
welfare
in
the
name
of
freedom
rights
or
equality
Fourth
people’s
views
of
what
is
right
and
wrong
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
influenced
by
their
beliefs
about
how
people
in
fact
behave
There
is
evidence
that
studying
theories
that
depict
individuals
as
self-interested
leads
people
to
regard
self-interested
behavior
more
favorably
and
to
become
more
self-interested
Marwell
and
Ames
1981
Frank
et
al
1993
Finally
people’s
judgments
are
clouded
by
their
interests
Since
economic
theories
bear
so
centrally
on
people’s
interests
there
are
bound
to
be
ideological
biases
at
work
in
the
discipline
Marx
1867
Preface
Positive
and
normative
are
especially
interlinked
within
economics
because
economists
are
not
all
researchers
and
teachers
In
addition
economists
work
as
commentators
and
as
it
were
hired
guns
whose
salaries
depend
on
arriving
at
the
conclusions
their
employers
want
The
bitter
polemics
concerning
macroeconomic
policy
responses
to
the
great
recession
beginning
in
2008
testify
to
the
influence
of
ideology

Reasons
versus
causes
Orthodox
theoretical
microeconomics
is
as
much
a
theory
of
rational
choices
as
it
a
theory
that
explains
and
predicts
economic
outcomes
Since
virtually
all
economic
theories
that
discuss
individual
choices
take
individuals
as
acting
for
reasons
and
thus
in
some
way
rational
questions
about
the
role
that
views
of
rationality
and
reasons
should
play
in
economics
are
of
general
importance
Economists
are
typically
concerned
with
the
aggregate
results
of
individual
choices
rather
than
with
the
actions
of
particular
individuals
but
their
theories
in
fact
offer
both
causal
explanations
for
why
individuals
choose
as
they
do
and
accounts
of
the
reasons
for
their
choices
See
also
the
entries
on
methodological
individualism
and
reasons
for
action
justification
motivation
explanation
Explanations
in
terms
of
reasons
have
several
features
that
distinguish
them
from
explanations
in
terms
of
causes
Reasons
purport
to
justify
the
actions
they
explain
and
indeed
so
called
external
reasons
Williams
1981
only
justify
action
without
purporting
to
explain
it
Reasons
can
be
evaluated
and
they
are
responsive
to
criticism
Reasons
unlike
causes
must
be
intelligible
to
those
for
whom
they
are
reasons
On
grounds
such
as
these
many
philosophers
have
questioned
whether
explanations
of
human
action
can
be
causal
explanations
von
Wright
1971
Winch
1958
Yet
merely
giving
a
reason
even
an
extremely
good
reason
fails
to
explain
an
agent’s
action
if
the
reason
was
not
in
fact
effective
Someone
might
for
example
start
attending
church
regularly
and
give
as
his
reason
a
concern
with
salvation
But
others
might
suspect
that
this
agent
is
deceiving
himself
and
that
the
minister’s
attractive
daughter
is
in
fact
responsible
for
his
renewed
interest
in
religion
Donald
Davidson
1963
argued
that
what
distinguishes
the
reasons
that
explain
an
action
from
the
reasons
that
fail
to
explain
it
is
that
the
former
are
also
causes
of
the
action
Although
the
account
of
rationality
within
economics
differs
in
some
ways
from
the
folk
psychology
people
tacitly
invoke
in
everyday
explanations
of
actions
many
of
the
same
questions
carry
over
Rosenberg
1976
ch
5
1980
Hausman
2012
An
additional
difference
between
explanations
in
terms
of
reasons
and
explanations
in
terms
of
causes
which
some
economists
have
emphasized
is
that
the
beliefs
and
preferences
that
explain
actions
may
depend
on
mistakes
and
ignorance
Knight
1935
As
a
first
approximation
economists
can
abstract
from
such
difficulties
caused
by
the
intentionality
of
belief
and
desire
They
thus
often
assume
that
people
have
perfect
information
about
all
the
relevant
facts
In
that
way
theorists
need
not
worry
about
what
people’s
beliefs
are
If
people
have
perfect
information
then
they
believe
and
expect
whatever
the
facts
are
But
once
one
goes
beyond
this
first
approximation
difficulties
arise
which
have
no
parallel
in
the
natural
sciences
Choice
depends
on
how
things
look
from
the
inside
which
may
be
very
different
from
the
actual
state
of
affairs
Consider
for
example
the
stock
market
The
true
value
of
a
stock
depends
on
the
future
profits
of
the
company
which
are
of
course
uncertain
In
2006
house
prices
in
the
U.S
were
extremely
inflated
But
whether
they
were
too
high
depended
at
least
in
the
short
run
on
what
people
believe
They
were
excellent
investments
if
one
could
sell
them
to
others
who
would
be
willing
to
pay
even
more
for
them
Economists
disagree
about
how
significant
this
subjectivity
is
Members
of
the
Austrian
school
argue
that
these
differences
are
of
great
importance
and
sharply
distinguish
theorizing
about
economics
from
theorizing
about
any
of
the
natural
sciences

and
Vanberg

Mises

Social
scientific
naturalism
Of
all
the
social
sciences
economics
most
closely
resembles
the
natural
sciences
Economic
theories
have
been
axiomatized
and
articles
and
books
of
economics
are
full
of
theorems
Of
all
the
social
sciences
only
economics
boasts
an
ersatz
Nobel
Prize
Economics
is
thus
a
test
case
for
those
concerned
with
the
extent
of
the
similarities
between
the
natural
and
social
sciences
Those
who
have
wondered
whether
social
sciences
must
differ
fundamentally
from
the
natural
sciences
seem
to
have
been
concerned
mainly
with
three
questions
i
Are
there
fundamental
differences
between
the
structure
or
concepts
of
theories
and
explanations
in
the
natural
and
social
sciences
Some
of
these
issues
were
already
mentioned
in
the
discussion
above
of
reasons
versus
causes
ii
Are
there
fundamental
differences
in
goals
Philosophers
and
economists
have
argued
that
in
addition
to
or
instead
of
the
predictive
and
explanatory
goals
of
the
natural
sciences
the
social
sciences
should
aim
at
providing
us
with
understanding
Weber
and
others
have
argued
that
the
social
sciences
should
provide
us
with
an
understanding
from
the
inside
that
we
should
be
able
to
empathize
with
the
reactions
of
the
agents
and
to
find
what
happens
understandable
Weber
1904
Knight
1935
Machlup
1969
a
This
and
the
closely
related
recognition
that
explanations
cite
reasons
rather
than
just
causes
seems
to
introduce
an
element
of
subjectivity
into
the
social
sciences
that
is
not
found
in
the
natural
sciences
iii
Owing
to
the
importance
of
human
choices
or
perhaps
free
will
are
social
phenomena
too
irregular
to
be
captured
within
a
framework
of
laws
and
theories
Given
human
free
will
perhaps
human
behavior
is
intrinsically
unpredictable
and
not
subject
to
any
laws
But
there
are
in
fact
many
regularities
in
human
action
and
given
the
enormous
causal
complexity
characterizing
some
natural
systems
the
natural
sciences
must
cope
with
many
irregularities
too

Abstraction
idealization
and
ceteris
paribus
clauses
in
economics
Economics
raises
questions
concerning
the
legitimacy
of
severe
abstraction
and
idealization
For
example
mainstream
economic
models
often
stipulate
that
everyone
is
perfectly
rational
and
has
perfect
information
or
that
commodities
are
infinitely
divisible
Such
claims
are
exaggerations
and
they
are
clearly
false
Other
schools
of
economics
may
not
employ
idealizations
that
are
this
extreme
but
there
is
no
way
to
do
economics
if
one
is
not
willing
to
simplify
drastically
and
abstract
from
many
complications
How
much
simplification
idealization
abstraction
or
isolation
Mäki
2006
is
legitimate
In
addition
because
economists
attempt
to
study
economic
phenomena
as
constituting
a
separate
domain
influenced
only
by
a
small
number
of
causal
factors
the
claims
of
economics
are
true
only
ceteris
paribus
that
is
they
are
true
only
if
there
are
no
interferences
or
disturbing
causes
What
are
ceteris
paribus
clauses
and
when
if
ever
are
they
legitimate
in
science
Questions
concerning
ceteris
paribus
clauses
are
closely
related
to
questions
concerning
simplifications
and
idealizations
since
one
way
to
simplify
is
to
suppose
that
the
various
disturbing
causes
or
interferences
are
inactive
and
to
explore
the
consequences
of
some
small
number
of
causal
factors
These
issues
and
the
related
question
of
how
well
supported
economics
is
by
the
evidence
have
been
the
central
questions
in
economic
methodology
They
will
be
discussed
further
below
mainly
in
Section
3

5
Causation
in
economics
and
econometrics
Many
important
generalizations
in
economics
are
causal
claims
For
example
the
law
of
demand
asserts
that
a
price
increase
will
ceteris
paribus
diminish
the
quantity
demanded
It
does
not
merely
assert
an
inverse
relationship
between
price
and
demand
When
demand
increases
for
some
other
reason
such
as
a
change
in
tastes
price
increases
Econometricians
have
also
been
deeply
concerned
with
the
possibilities
of
determining
causal
relations
from
statistical
evidence
and
with
the
relevance
of
causal
relations
to
the
possibility
of
consistent
estimation
of
parameter
values
Since
concerns
about
the
consequences
of
alternative
policies
are
so
central
to
economics
causal
inquiry
is
unavoidable
Before
the
1930
s
economists
were
generally
willing
to
use
causal
language
explicitly
and
literally
despite
some
concerns
that
there
might
be
a
conflict
between
causal
analysis
of
economic
changes
and
comparative
statics
treatments
of
equilibrium
states
Some
economists
were
also
worried
that
thinking
in
terms
of
causes
was
not
compatible
with
recognizing
the
multiplicity
and
mutuality
of
determination
in
economic
equilibrium
In
the
anti-metaphysical
intellectual
environment
of
the
1930
s
and
1940
s
of
which
logical
positivism
was
at
least
symptomatic
any
mention
of
causation
became
suspicious
and
economists
commonly
pretended
to
avoid
causal
concepts
The
consequence
was
that
they
ceased
to
reflect
carefully
on
the
causal
concepts
that
they
continued
implicitly
to
invoke
Hausman
1983
1990
Helm
1984
Runde
1998
For
example
rather
than
formulating
the
law
of
demand
in
terms
of
the
causal
consequences
of
price
changes
for
quantity
demanded
economists
tried
to
confine
themselves
to
discussing
the
mathematical
function
relating
price
and
quantity
demanded
There
were
important
exceptions
Haavelmo
1944
Simon
1953
Wold
1954
and
during
the
past
generation
this
state
of
affairs
has
changed
dramatically
For
example
in
his
Causality
in
Macroeconomics
2001
b
Kevin
Hoover
develops
feasible
methods
for
investigating
large
scale
causal
questions
such
as
whether
changes
in
the
money
supply
M
cause
changes
in
the
rate
of
inflation
P
or
accommodate
changes
in
P
that
are
otherwise
caused
If
changes
in
M
cause
changes
in
P
then
the
conditional
distribution
of
P
on
M
should
remain
stable
with
exogenous
changes
in
M
but
should
change
with
exogenous
changes
in
P
Hoover
argues
that
historical
investigation
backed
by
statistical
inquiry
can
justify
the
conclusion
that
some
particular
changes
in
M
or
P
have
been
exogenous
One
can
then
determine
the
causal
direction
by
examining
the
stability
of
the
conditional
distributions
Econometricians
have
made
vital
contributions
to
the
contemporary
revival
of
philosophical
interest
in
the
notion
of
causation
In
addition
to
Hoover’s
work
see
for
example
Geweke
1982
Granger
1969
1980
Cartwright
1989

Aigner

Spirtes
Glymour
and
Scheines

One
relatively
secure
way
to
determine
causal
relations
is
via
randomized
controlled
experiments
If
the
experimenters
sort
subjects
randomly
into
experimental
and
control
groups
and
vary
just
one
factor
then
unless
by
bad
luck
the
two
groups
differ
in
some
unknown
way
changes
in
the
outcomes
given
the
common
features
of
the
control
and
treatment
groups
should
be
due
to
the
difference
in
the
one
factor
Indeed
in
the
case
of
quantitative
variables
one
can
calculate
average
causal
effects
Deaton
2010
This
makes
randomized
controlled
trials
very
attractive
though
no
panacea
since
the
treatment
and
control
groups
may
not
be
representative
of
the
population
in
which
policy-makers
hope
to
apply
the
causal
conclusions
and
the
causal
consequences
of
the
intervention
might
differ
across
different
subgroups
within
the
control
and
treatment
groups
Worrall

Cartwright
and
Hardie

For
both
practical
and
ethical
reasons
it
is
often
hard
to
experiment
in
economics
though
as
discussed
in
section
4
5
far
from
impossible
But
with
some
ingenuity
and
with
far
greater
enthusiasm
for
experimentation
than
had
been
the
case
previously
economists
are
experimenting
much
more
frequently
both
in
the
laboratory
and
in
the
field
In
addition
as
a
substitute
for
experimentation
or
as
a
way
of
stretching
the
limits
on
experimentation
economists
in
recent
years
have
become
very
enthusiastic
about
so-called
instrumental
variable
techniques
For
example
merely
examining
the
correlation
between
economic
growth
and
development
aid
even
controlling
for
other
factors
known
to
influence
economic
growth
is
unlikely
to
reveal
the
causal
influence
of
aid
on
growth
because
aid
may
reciprocally
depend
on
growth
and
well
as
many
factors
that
are
hard
to
measure
that
also
influence
growth
These
problems
can
be
to
some
extent
circumvented
if
economists
can
find
an
instrumental
variable
x
upon
which
aid
depends
that
influences
growth
if
at
all
only
by
its
influence
on
aid
and
which
is
probabilistically
independent
of
all
other
determinants
of
growth
In
that
case
one
can
use
the
effect
of
x
on
growth
to
estimate
the
effect
of
aid
on
growth
Instrumental
variable
techniques
policy
experimentation
and
reliance
on
natural
experiments
have
become
widespread
though
they
bring
with
them
new
problems
extrapolating
experimental
results
to
the
target
population

Structure
and
strategy
of
economics
paradigms
and
research
programmes
In
the
wake
of
the
work
of
Kuhn
1970
and
Lakatos
1970
philosophers
are
much
more
aware
of
and
interested
in
the
larger
theoretical
structures
that
unify
and
guide
research
within
particular
research
traditions
Since
many
theoretical
projects
or
approaches
in
economics
are
systematically
unified
they
pose
questions
about
what
guides
research
and
many
economists
have
applied
the
work
of
Kuhn
or
Lakatos
in
the
attempt
to
shed
light
on
the
overall
structure
of
economics

Whether
these
applications
have
been
successful
is
controversial
but
the
comparison
of
the
structure
of
economics
to
Kuhn’s
and
Lakatos
schema
served
to
highlight
distinctive
features
of
economics
and
may
have
contributed
to
some
of
the
changes
that
economics
has
undergone
For
example
asking
what
the
positive
heuristic
of
mainstream
economics
consists
in
permits
one
to
see
that
mainstream
theoretical
models
typically
attempted
to
demonstrate
that
an
economic
equilibrium
will
obtain
and
thus
that
mainstream
models
were
unified
in
more
than
just
their
common
assumptions
Since
the
success
of
research
projects
in
economics
is
controversial
understanding
their
global
structure
and
strategy
helped
to
clarify
their
drawbacks
as
well
as
their
advantages
3
Inexactness
ceteris
paribus
clauses
tendencies
unrealistic
assumptions
and
models
As
mentioned
in
the
previous
section
the
most
important
methodological
issue
concerning
economics
involves
the
very
considerable
simplification
idealization
and
abstraction
that
characterizes
economic
theory
and
the
consequent
doubts
these
features
of
economics
raise
concerning
whether
economics
is
well
supported
Claims
such
as
Agents
prefer
larger
commodity
bundles
to
smaller
commodity
bundles
raise
serious
questions
because
if
they
are
interpreted
as
universal
generalizations
they
are
false
and
philosophy
of
science
has
traditionally
supposed
that
science
is
devoted
to
the
discovery
of
genuine
laws—that
is
true
universal
generalizations
Even
though
it
is
false
that
everyone
always
prefers
larger
commodity
bundles
to
smaller
the
generalization
seems
informative
and
useful
Can
a
science
rest
on
false
generalizations
If
these
claims
are
not
universal
generalizations
then
what
is
their
logical
form
And
how
can
claims
that
appear
in
this
way
to
be
false
or
approximate
be
tested
and
confirmed
or
disconfirmed
These
problems
have
bedeviled
economists
and
economic
methodologists
from
the
first
methodological
reflections
to
the
present
day

and
the
method
a
priori
The
first
extended
reflections
on
economic
methodology
appear
in
the
work
of
Nassau
Senior
1836
and
John
Stuart
Mill
1836
Their
essays
must
be
understood
against
the
background
of
both
the
economic
theory
and
the
philosophy
of
science
of
their
times
Like
Smith’s
economics
to
which
it
owed
a
great
deal
and
modern
economics
the
classical
economics
of
the
middle
decades
of
the
19
th
century
traced
economic
regularities
to
the
choices
of
individuals
facing
social
and
natural
constraints
But
as
compared
to
Smith
more
reliance
was
placed
on
severely
simplified
models
David
Ricardo’s
Principles
of
Political
Economy
1817
draws
a
portrait
in
which
wages
above
the
subsistence
level
lead
to
increases
in
the
population
which
in
turn
require
more
intensive
agriculture
or
cultivation
of
inferior
land
The
extension
of
cultivation
leads
to
lower
profits
and
higher
rents
and
the
whole
tale
of
economic
development
leads
to
a
gloomy
stationary
state
in
which
profits
are
too
low
to
command
any
net
investment
wages
slide
back
to
subsistence
levels
and
only
the
landlords
are
affluent
Fortunately
for
the
world
but
unfortunately
for
economic
theorists
of
the
mid
19
th
century
the
data
consistently
contradicted
the
trends
the
theory
predicted
de
Marchi
1970
Yet
the
theory
continued
to
hold
sway
for
more
than
half
a
century
and
the
consistently
unfavorable
data
were
explained
away
as
due
to
various
disturbing
causes
It
is
consequently
not
surprising
that
Senior’s
and
Mill’s
accounts
of
the
method
of
economics
emphasize
the
relative
autonomy
of
theory
Mill
distinguishes
between
two
main
kinds
of
inductive
methods
The
method
a
posteriori
is
a
method
of
direct
experience
In
his
view
it
is
only
suitable
for
phenomena
in
which
few
causal
factors
are
operating
or
in
which
experimental
controls
are
possible
Mill’s
famous
methods
of
induction
provide
an
articulation
of
the
method
a
posteriori
In
his
method
of
difference
for
example
one
holds
fixed
every
causal
factor
except
one
and
checks
to
see
whether
the
effect
ceases
to
obtain
when
that
one
factor
is
removed
The
goal
is
to
identify
exceptionless
causal
laws
Mill
maintains
that
direct
inductive
methods
cannot
be
used
to
study
phenomena
in
which
many
causal
factors
are
in
play
If
for
example
one
attempts
to
investigate
whether
tariffs
enhance
or
impede
prosperity
by
comparing
the
prosperity
of
nations
with
high
tariffs
and
nations
without
high
tariffs
the
results
will
be
uninformative
because
prosperity
depends
on
so
many
other
causal
factors
So
Mill
argues
one
needs
instead
to
employ
the
method
a
priori
Despite
its
name
this
too
is
an
inductive
method
However
unlike
the
method
a
posteriori
the
method
a
priori
is
an
indirect
inductive
method
Scientists
first
determine
the
laws
governing
individual
causal
factors
in
domains
in
which
Mill’s
methods
of
induction
are
applicable
Having
then
determined
the
laws
of
the
individual
causes
they
investigate
their
combined
consequences
deductively
Finally
there
is
a
role
for
verification
of
the
combined
consequences
but
owing
to
the
causal
complications
this
testing
has
comparatively
little
weight
The
testing
of
the
conclusions
serves
only
as
a
check
on
the
scientist’s
deductions
and
as
an
indicator
of
whether
there
are
significant
disturbing
causes
that
scientists
have
not
yet
accounted
for
Mill
gives
the
example
of
the
science
of
the
tides
Physicists
determined
the
law
of
gravitation
by
studying
planetary
motion
in
which
gravity
is
the
only
significant
causal
factor
Then
physicists
develop
the
theory
of
tides
deductively
from
that
law
and
information
concerning
the
positions
and
motions
of
the
moon
and
sun
The
implications
of
the
theory
will
be
inexact
and
sometimes
badly
mistaken
because
many
subsidiary
causal
factors
influence
tides
Testing
theories
of
tides
can
uncover
mistakes
in
the
deductions
physicists
made
and
it
may
uncover
evidence
concerning
the
role
of
the
subsidiary
factors
But
because
of
the
causal
complexity
such
testing
does
little
to
confirm
or
disconfirm
the
law
of
gravitation
which
has
already
been
established
Although
Mill
does
not
often
use
the
language
of
ceteris
paribus
his
view
that
the
principles
or
laws
of
economics
hold
in
the
absence
of
interferences
or
disturbing
causes
provides
an
account
of
how
the
principles
of
economics
can
be
true
ceteris
paribus
Hausman
1992
ch
8
12
Because
economic
theory
includes
only
the
most
important
causes
and
necessarily
ignores
minor
causes
its
claims
like
claims
concerning
tides
are
inexact
Its
predictions
will
be
imprecise
and
sometimes
far
off
Mill
maintains
that
it
is
nevertheless
possible
to
develop
and
confirm
economic
theory
by
studying
in
simpler
domains
the
laws
governing
the
major
causal
factors
and
then
deducing
their
consequences
in
more
complicated
circumstances
For
example
the
statistical
data
are
ambiguous
concerning
the
relationship
between
minimum
wages
and
unemployment
of
unskilled
workers
and
since
the
minimum
wage
has
never
been
extremely
high
there
are
no
data
about
what
unemployment
would
be
in
those
circumstances
On
the
other
hand
everyday
experience
teaches
economists
that
firms
can
choose
among
more
or
less
labor-intensive
processes
and
that
a
high
minimum
wage
will
make
more
labor-intensive
processes
more
expensive
On
the
assumption
that
firms
try
to
keep
their
costs
down
economists
have
good
though
not
conclusive
reason
to
believe
that
a
high
minimum
wage
will
increase
unemployment
In
defending
a
view
of
economics
as
in
this
way
inexact
and
employing
the
method
a
priori
Mill
thought
he
was
able
to
reconcile
his
empiricism
and
his
commitment
to
Ricardo’s
economics
Although
Mill’s
views
on
economic
methodology
were
challenged
later
in
the
nineteenth
century
by
economists
who
believed
that
theory
was
too
remote
from
the
contingencies
of
policy
and
history
Roscher
1874
Schmoller
1888
1898
Mill’s
methodological
views
dominated
the
mainstream
of
economic
theory
for
a
century
for
example
Cairnes
1875
Mill’s
vision
survived
the
so-called
neoclassical
revolution
in
economics
beginning
in
the
1870
s
and
is
clearly
discernible
in
the
most
important
methodological
treatises
concerning
neoclassical
economics
such
as
John
Neville
Keynes
The
Scope
and
Method
of
Political
Economy
1891
or
Lionel
Robbins
An
Essay
on
the
Nature
and
Significance
of
Economic
Science
1932
Hausman
1992
argues
that
current
methodological
practice
closely
resembles
Mill’s
methodology
despite
the
fact
that
few
economists
explicitly
defend
it
Although
this
way
of
interpreting
Mill
and
the
methodology
of
economics
is
coherent
and
conforms
to
an
old-fashioned
empiricist
philosophy
of
science
that
finds
the
nomological
force
of
generalizations
in
their
universality
it
is
not
faithful
to
the
way
in
which
economists
see
their
theories
Rather
than
regarding
generalizations
such
as
acquisitiveness
as
universal
laws
carrying
implicit
ceteris
paribus
qualifications
in
their
antecedents
economists
are
much
more
likely
to
regard
these
generalizations
as
tendencies
that
continue
to
operate
even
when
defeated
by
interferences
and
that
need
to
be
studied
separately
Woodward
2003
Even
Mill
speaks
of
tendencies
though
without
reconciling
his
talk
of
tendencies
with
his
empiricism
If
one
sets
aside
metaphysical
qualms
about
tendencies
and
counterfactuals
the
most
natural
way
to
see
economic
theorizing
is
as
the
counterfactual
investigation
of
combinations
of
tendencies
As
the
discussion
below
of
models
confirms
such
views
are
congenial
to
economists
and
puzzling
to
philosophers
with
empiricist
scruples
Conceptualizing
of
economic
inquiry
as
the
study
of
models
and
tendencies
seems
to
shift
the
terms
of
the
problems
posed
by
inexactness
rather
than
to
offer
a
solution
Julian
Reiss
has
in
effect
rediscovered
the
problem
in
an
influential
essay
The
Explanation
Paradox
2013
where
he
argues
that
the
following
three
propositions
are
inconsistent
1
Economic
models
are
false
2
Economic
models
are
explanatory
3
Explanation
requires
truth.The
formulation
is
a
bit
obscure
since
models
are
not
single
sentences
or
propositions
that
can
be
true
or
false
but
it
should
be
clear
that
Reiss’s
putative
paradox
is
a
reformulation
of
the
problem
posed
by
the
inexactness
of
economic
theories
or
models

Friedman
and
the
defense
of
unrealistic
assumptions
Although
some
contemporary
philosophers
have
argued
that
Mill’s
method
a
priori
is
largely
defensible
Bhaskar
1975
Cartwright
1989
and
Hausman
1992
by
the
middle
of
the
Twentieth
Century
Mill’s
views
appeared
to
many
economists
out
of
step
with
their
understanding
of
contemporary
philosophy
of
science
Without
studying
Mill’s
text
carefully
it
was
easy
for
economists
to
misunderstand
his
terminology
and
to
regard
his
method
a
priori
as
opposed
to
empiricism
Others
took
seriously
Mill’s
view
that
the
basic
principles
of
economics
should
be
empirically
established
and
found
evidence
to
cast
doubt
on
some
of
the
basic
principles
particularly
the
view
that
firms
attempt
to
maximize
profits
Hall
and
Hitch
1938
Lester
1946
1947
Methodologists
who
were
well-informed
about
contemporary
developments
in
philosophy
of
science
such
as
Terence
Hutchison
1938
denounced
pure
theory
in
economics
as
unscientific
Philosophically
reflective
economists
proposed
several
ways
to
replace
the
old-fashioned
Millian
view
with
a
more
up-to-date
methodology
that
would
continue
to
justify
much
of
current
practice
see
particularly
Machlup
1955
1960
and
Koopmans
1957
By
far
the
most
influential
of
these
efforts
was
Milton
Friedman’s
1953
essay
The
Methodology
of
Positive
Economics
This
essay
has
had
an
enormous
influence
far
more
than
any
other
work
on
methodology
Friedman
begins
his
essay
by
distinguishing
in
a
conventional
way
between
positive
and
normative
economics
and
conjecturing
that
policy
disputes
are
typically
really
disputes
about
the
consequences
of
alternatives
and
can
thus
be
resolved
by
progress
in
positive
economics
Turning
to
positive
economics
Friedman
asserts
without
argument
that
correct
prediction
concerning
phenomena
not
yet
observed
is
the
ultimate
goal
of
all
positive
sciences
He
holds
a
practical
view
of
science
and
finds
the
value
of
science
in
predictions
that
will
guide
policy
Since
it
is
difficult
and
often
impossible
to
carry
out
experiments
and
since
the
uncontrolled
phenomena
economists
observe
are
difficult
to
interpret
owing
to
the
same
causal
complexity
that
bothered
Mill
it
is
hard
to
judge
whether
a
particular
theory
is
a
good
basis
for
predictions
or
not
Tendencies
are
not
universal
laws
A
claim
such
as
firms
attempt
to
maximize
profits
will
be
unrealistic
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
a
true
universal
generalization
Although
not
in
these
terms
Friedman
objects
to
criticisms
of
tendencies
that
in
effect
complain
that
they
are
merely
tendencies
rather
than
universal
laws
If
his
criticism
stopped
there
it
would
be
sensible
although
it
would
avoid
the
problems
of
understanding
and
appraising
claims
about
tendencies
But
Friedman
draws
a
much
more
radical
conclusion
In
his
terminology
the
mistake
economists
make
who
criticize
claims
such
as
firms
attempt
to
maximize
profits
lies
in
the
attempt
to
test
theories
by
the
realism
of
their
assumptions
rather
than
by
the
accuracy
of
their
predictions
He
maintains
that
the
realism
of
a
theory’s
assumptions
is
irrelevant
to
its
predictive
value
It
does
not
matter
whether
the
assumption
that
firms
maximize
profits
is
realistic
Theories
should
be
appraised
exclusively
in
terms
of
the
accuracy
of
their
predictions
What
matters
is
exclusively
whether
the
theory
of
the
firm
makes
correct
and
significant
predictions
As
critics
have
pointed
out
and
almost
all
commentators
have
been
critical
Friedman
refers
to
several
different
things
as
assumptions
of
a
theory
and
means
several
different
things
by
speaking
of
assumptions
as
unrealistic
Brunner
1969
Since
Friedman
aims
his
criticism
to
those
who
investigate
empirically
whether
firms
in
fact
attempt
to
maximize
profits
he
must
take
assumptions
to
include
central
economic
generalizations
such
as
Firms
attempt
to
maximize
profits
and
by
unrealistic
he
must
mean
among
other
things
false
In
arguing
that
it
is
a
mistake
to
appraise
theories
in
terms
of
the
realism
of
assumptions
Friedman
is
arguing
at
least
that
it
is
a
mistake
to
appraise
theories
by
investigating
whether
their
central
generalizations
are
true
or
false
It
would
seem
that
this
interpretation
would
render
Friedman’s
views
inconsistent
because
in
testing
whether
firms
attempt
to
maximize
profits
one
is
checking
whether
predictions
of
theory
concerning
the
behavior
of
firms
are
true
or
false
An
assumption
such
as
firms
maximize
profits
is
itself
a
prediction
But
there
is
a
further
wrinkle
Friedman
is
not
concerned
with
every
prediction
of
economic
theories
In
Friedman’s
view
theory
is
to
be
judged
by
its
predictive
power
exclusively
for
the
class
of
phenomena
which
it
is
intended
to
explain
1953

Economists
are
interested
in
only
some
of
the
implications
of
economic
theories
Other
predictions
such
as
those
concerning
the
results
of
surveys
of
managers
are
irrelevant
to

What
matters
is
whether
economic
theories
are
successful
at
predicting
the
phenomena
that
economists
are
interested
in
In
other
words
Friedman
believes
that
economic
theories
should
be
appraised
in
terms
of
their
predictions
concerning
prices
and
quantities
exchanged
on
markets
In
his
view
what

is
narrow
predictive
success
Hausman
2008
a
not
overall
predictive
adequacy
So
Friedman
permits
economists
to
ignore
the
disquieting
findings
of
surveys
or
the
fact
that
people
do
not
always
prefer
larger
bundles
of
commodities
to
smaller
bundles
of
commodities
Nor
do
economists
need
to
be
concerned
about
whether
there
is
a
tendency
to
prefer
more
commodities
to
fewer
They
need
not
be
troubled
that
some
of
their
models
suppose
extravagantly
that
all
agents
know
the
prices
of
all
present
and
future
commodities
in
all
markets
All
that
matters
is
whether
the
predictions
concerning
market
phenomena
turn
out
to
be
correct
And
since
anomalous
market
outcomes
could
be
due
to
any
number
of
uncontrolled
causal
factors
while
experiments
are
difficult
to
carry
out
it
turns
out
that
economists
need
not
worry
about
ever
encountering
evidence
that
would
strongly
disconfirm
fundamental
theory
Detailed
models
may
be
confirmed
or
disconfirmed
but
fundamental
theory
is
safe
In
this
way
one
can
understand
how
Friedman’s
methodology
which
appears
to
justify
the
eclectic
and
pragmatic
view
that
economists
should
use
any
model
that
appears
to
work
regardless
of
how
absurd
or
unreasonable
its
assumptions
might
appear
has
been
deployed
in
service
of
a
rigid
theoretical
orthodoxy

there
has

Friedman’s

probably
do
not

the

near
unanimity
that

they

Models
A
century
ago
economists
talked
of
their
work
in
terms
of
principles
laws
and
theories
That
language
has
not
disappeared
altogether
economists
still
talk
of
game
theory
consumer
choice
theory
or
the
law
of
demand
But
nowadays
the
standard
intellectual
tool
or
form
in
economics
is
a
model
Econometricians
speak
of
models
and
structures
Economists
are
more
comfortable
describing
the
axioms
concerning
rational
choice
as
constituting
a
model
of
rational
choice
than
as
delineating
a
theory
of
rational
choice
Many
of
the
most
distinguished
commentators
on
models
regard
them
as
fictional
worlds
whose
study
informs
our
understanding
of
actual
phenomena

models
is

In
their
view
economists
are
able
to
investigate
how
causal
factors
would
operate
in
the
absence
of
interferences
by
constructing
models
that
is
fictional
economies—in
which
the
interferences
are
absent
Uskali
Mäki
maintains
that
Models
are
experiments
Experiments
are
models
2005
Dani
Rodrik
2015
argues
that
economics
consists
of
a
collection
of
models
and
that
doing
economics
consists
in
selecting
or
customizing
a
model
from
this
collection
Is
the
ubiquity
of
talk
of
models
just
a
change
in
terminological
fashion
or
does
the
concern
with
models
which
is
by
no
means
unique
to
economics
signal
a
methodological
shift
What
are
models

questions

The
view
of
models
to
which
economists
are
most
attracted
is
philosophically
problematic
because
it
is
apparently
committed
to
the
existence
of
fictional
entities
whose
properties
and
causal
propensities
economists
can
investigate
In
experiments
whether
carried
out
in
a
laboratory
or
in
the
field
experimenters
interact
causally
with
flesh
and
blood
experimental
subjects
and
the
outcome
may
contradict
the
economist’s
predictions
In
investigating
a
model
in
contrast
the
economist
interacts
with
fictional
entities
which
are
arguably
nothing
other
than
his
or
her
own
thoughts
and
the
logical
implications
of
the
axioms
that
define
the
model
are
never
disappointed
This
is
not
to
say
that
the
logical
investigation
of
models
never
results
in
surprises
Humans
are
not
logically
omniscient
and
discovering
the
implications
of
a
set
of
axioms
may
be
an
arduous
task
But
it
is
a
different
task
than
carrying
out
an
experiment
in
the
laboratory
or
the
field
and
ontology
of
the
worlds
that
economists
allegedly
create
and
then
study
is
deeply
puzzling
Although
less
faithful
to
economic
practice
it
is
far
more
intelligible
philosophically
to
regard
models
as
predicates
or
as
definitions
of
predicates
Hausman
1992
For
example
when
economists
write
down
a
model
of
a
firm
with
a
single
output
and
just
two
inputs
they
are
defining
a
concept
that
they
can
use
to
describe
actual
firms

Influential
approaches
to
economic
methodology
The
past
half
century
has
witnessed
the
emergence
of
a
large
literature
devoted
to
economic
methodology
That
literature
explores
many
methodological
approaches
and
applies
its
conclusions
to
many
schools
and
branches
of
economics
Much
of
the
literature
has
focused
on
the
fundamental
theory
of
mainstream
economics
the
theory
of
the
equilibria
resulting
from
constrained
rational
individual
choice
but
the
tremendous
importance
of
macroeconomics
in
determining
the
proper
responses
to
the
great
recession
beginning
in
2008
coupled
with
the
rapidly
increasing
role
of
empirical
and
experimental
inquiries
in
the
day-to-day
work
of
economists
have
seen
echoes
in
methodological
inquiries
Backhouse
2010
Since
1985
there
has
been
a
journal
Economics
and
Philosophy
devoted
specifically
to
philosophy
of
economics
and
since
1994
there
has
also
been
a
Journal
of
Economic
Methodology
This
section
will
sample
some
of
the
methodological
approaches
of
the
past
two
decades
4
1
Popperian
approaches
Karl
Popper’s
philosophy
of
science
has
been
influential
among
economists
as
among
other
scientists
Popper
defends
what
he
calls
a
falsificationist
methodology
1968
1969
Scientists
should
formulate
theories
that
are
logically
falsifiable
that
is
inconsistent
with
some
possible
observation
reports
All
crows
are
black
is
logically
falsifiable
it
is
inconsistent
with
and
would
be
falsified
by
an
observation
report
of
a
red
crow
Probabilistic
claims
are
obviously
not
in
this
sense
falsifiable
Popper
insists
on
falsifiability
on
the
grounds
that
unfalsifiable
claims
that
rule
out
no
observations
are
uninformative
They
provide
no
guidance
concerning
what
to
expect
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
learned
from
testing
them
Second
Popper
maintains
that
scientists
should
subject
theories
to
harsh
test
and
should
be
willing
to
reject
them
when
they
fail
the
tests
Third
scientists
should
regard
theories
as
at
best
interesting
conjectures
Passing
a
test
does
not
confirm
a
theory
or
provide
scientists
with
reason
to
believe
it
It
only
justifies
on
the
one
hand
continuing
to
employ
the
hypothesis
since
it
has
not
yet
been
falsified
and
on
the
other
hand
devoting
increased
efforts
to
attempting
to
falsify
it
since
it
has
thus
far
survived
testing
Popper
has
defended
what
he
calls
situational
logic
which
is
basically
rational
choice
theory
as
the
correct
method
for
the
social
sciences
1967
1976
There
appear
to
be
serious
tensions
between
Popper’s
falsificationism
and
his
defense
of
situational
logic
and
his
discussion
of
situational
logic
has
not
been
as
influential
as
his
falsificationism
For
discussion
of
how
situational
logic
applies
to
economics
see
Hands
1985
a
Given
Popper’s
falsificationism
there
seems
little
hope
of
understanding
how
extreme
simplifications
can
be
legitimate
or
how
current
economic
practice
could
be
scientifically
reputable
Economic
theories
and
models
are
almost
all
unfalsifiable
and
if
they
were
the
widespread
acceptance
of
Friedman’s
methodological
views
would
insure
that
they
are
not
subjected
to
serious
test
When
models
apparently
fail
tests
they
are
rarely
repudiated
Economists
conclude
instead
merely
that
they
chose
the
wrong
model
for
the
task
or
that
there
were
disturbing
causes
Economic
models
which
have
not
been
well
tested
are
often
taken
to
be
well-established
guides
to
policy
rather
than
merely
conjectures
Critics
of
neoclassical
economics
have
made
these
criticisms
Eichner
1983
but
most
of
those
who
have
espoused
Popper’s
philosophy
of
science
have
not
repudiated
mainstream
economics
and
have
not
been
harshly
critical
of
its
practitioners
Mark
Blaug
1992
and
Terence
Hutchison
1938
1977
1978
2000
who
are
the
most
prominent
Popperian
methodologists
criticize
particular
features
of
economics
and
they
both
call
for
more
testing
and
a
more
critical
attitude
For
example
Blaug
praises
Gary
Becker
1976
for
his
refusal
to
explain
differences
in
choices
by
differences
in
preferences
but
criticizes
him
for
failing
to
go
on
and
test
his
theories
severely
1980
a
chapter
14
However
both
Blaug
and
Hutchison
understate
the
radicalism
of
Popper’s
views
and
take
his
message
to
be
little
more
than
that
scientists
should
be
critical
and
concerned
to
test
their
theories
Blaug’s
and
Hutchison’s
criticisms
have
sometimes
been
challenged
on
the
grounds
that
economic
theories
cannot
be
tested
because
of
their
ceteris
paribus
clauses
and
the
many
subsidiary
assumptions
required
to
derive
testable
implications
Caldwell
1984
But
this
response
ignores
Popper’s
insistence
that
testing
requires
methodological
decisions
not
to
attribute
failures
of
predictions
to
mistakes
in
subsidiary
assumptions
or
to
interferences

of
Popper’s
philosophy
and
its
applicability
to
economics

Marchi

Backhouse

Applying
Popper’s
views
on
falsification
literally
would
be
destructive
Not
only
neoclassical
economics
but
all
significant
economic
theories
would
be
condemned
as
unscientific
and
there
would
be
no
way
to
discriminate
among
economic
theories
One
major
problem
with
a
naive
reading
of
Popper’s
views
is
that
one
cannot
derive
testable
implications
from
theories
by
themselves
To
derive
testable
implications
one
also
needs
subsidiary
assumptions
concerning
probability
distributions
measurement
devices
proxies
for
unmeasured
variables
the
absence
of
interferences
and
so
forth
This
is
the
so-called
Duhem-Quine
problem
Duhem
1906
Quine
1953
Cross
1982
These
problems
arise
generally
and
Popper
proposes
that
they
be
solved
by
a
methodological
decision
to
regard
a
failure
of
the
deduced
testable
implication
to
be
a
failure
of
the
theory
But
in
economics
the
subsidiary
assumptions
are
dubious
and
in
many
cases
known
to
be
false
Making
the
methodological
decision
that
Popper
requires
is
unreasonable
and
would
lead
one
to
reject
all
economic
theories
Imre
Lakatos
1970
who
was
for
most
of
his
philosophical
career
a
follower
of
Popper
offers
a
broadly
Popperian
solution
to
this
problem
Lakatos
insists
that
testing
is
always
comparative
When
theories
face
empirical
difficulties
as
they
always
do
one
attempts
to
modify
them
Scientifically
acceptable
in
Lakatos
terminology
theoretically
progressive
modifications
must
always
have
some
additional
testable
implications
otherwise
they
are
purely
ad
hoc
If
some
of
the
new
predictions
are
confirmed
then
the
modification
is
empirically
progressive
and
one
has
reason
to
reject
the
unmodified
theory
and
to
employ
the
new
theory
regardless
of
how
unsuccessful
in
general
either
theory
may
be
Though
progress
may
be
hard
to
come
by
Lakatos
views
do
not
have
the
same
destructive
implications
as
Popper’s
Lakatos
appears
to
solve
the
problem
of
how
to
appraise
mainstream
economic
theory
by
arguing
that
what
matters
is
empirical
progress
or
retrogression
rather
than
empirical
success
or
failure
Lakatos
views
have
thus
been
more
attractive
to
economic
methodologists
than
Popper’s
Developing
Thomas
Kuhn’s
notion
of
a
paradigm
1970
and
some
hints
from
Popper
Lakatos
also
presented
a
view
of
the
global
theory
structure
of
whole
theoretical
enterprises
which
he
called
scientific
research
programmes
Lakatos
emphasized
that
there
is
a
hard
core
of
basic
theoretical
propositions
that
define
a
research
programme
and
that
are
not
to
be
questioned
within
the
research
programme
In
addition
members
of
a
research
programme
accept
a
common
body
of
heuristics
that
guide
them
in
the
articulation
and
modification
of
specific
theories
These
views
have
also
been
attractive
to
economic
methodologists
since
theory
development
in
economics
is
sharply
constrained
and
since
economics
appears
at
first
glance
to
have
a
hard
core
The
fact
that
economists
do
not
give
up
basic
theoretical
postulates
that
appear
to
be
false
might
be
explained
and
justified
by
regarding
them
as
part
of
the
hard
core
of
the
neoclassical
research
programme
Yet
Lakatos
views
do
not
provide
a
satisfactory
account
of
how
economics
can
be
a
reputable
science
despite
its
reliance
on
extreme
simplifications
For
it
is
questionable
whether
the
development
of
neoclassical
economic
theory
has
demonstrated
empirical
progress
For
example
the
replacement
of
cardinal
utility
theory
by
ordinal
utility
theory
see
below
Section
5
1
in
the
1930
s
which
is
generally
regarded
as
a
major
step
forward
involved
the
replacement
of
one
theory
by
another
that
had
no
additional
empirical
content
Furthermore
despite
his
emphasis
on
heuristics
as
guiding
theory
modification
Lakatos
still
emphasizes
testing
Science
is
for
Lakatos
more
empirically
driven
than
mainstream
economics
has
been
Hands
1992
It
is
also
doubtful
whether
research
enterprises
in
economics
have
hard
cores
Hoover
1991
Hausman
1992
ch
6
For
attempts
to
apply
Lakatos
views
to
economics
see
Latsis
1976
and
Weintraub
1985
As
is
apparent
in
de
Marchi
and
Blaug
1991
writers
on
economic
methodology
have
in
recent
years
become
increasingly
disenchanted
with
Lakatos
philosophy
Backhouse
2009
There
is
a
second
major
problem
with
Popper’s
philosophy
of
science
which
plagues
Lakatos
views
as
well
Both
maintain
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
empirical
confirmation
for
some
late
qualms
see
Lakatos
1974
Popper
and
Lakatos
maintain
that
evidence
never
provides
reason
to
believe
that
scientific
claims
are
true
and
both
also
deny
that
results
of
tests
can
justify
relying
on
statements
in
practical
endeavours
or
in
theoretical
inquiry
There
is
no
better
evidence
for
one
unfalsified
proposition
than
for
another
On
this
view
someone
who
questions
whether
there
is
enough
evidence
for
some
proposition
to
justify
relying
on
it
in
theoretical
studies
or
for
policy
purposes
would
be
making
the
methodological
error
of
supposing
that
there
can
be
evidence
in
support
of
hypotheses
With
the
notable
exception
of
Watkins
1984
few
philosophers
within
the
Popperian
tradition
have
faced
up
to
this
challenging
consequence
4
2
The
rhetoric
of
economics
One
radical
reaction
to
the
difficulties
of
justifying
the
reliance
on
severe
simplifications
is
to
deny
that
economics
passes
methodological
muster
Alexander
Rosenberg
1992
maintains
that
economics
can
only
make
imprecise
generic
predictions
and
it
cannot
make
progress
because
it
is
built
around
folk
psychology
which
is
a
mediocre
theory
of
human
behavior
and
which
owing
to
the
irreducibility
of
intentional
notions
cannot
be
improved
Complex
economic
theories
are
scientifically
valuable
only
as
applied
mathematics
not
as
empirical
theory
Since
economics
does
not
show
the
same
consistent
progress
as
the
natural
sciences
one
cannot
dismiss
Rosenberg’s
suggestion
that
economics
is
an
empirical
dead
end
But
his
view
that
it
has
made
no
progress
and
that
it
does
not
permit
quantitative
predictions
is
hard
to
accept
For
example
contemporary
economists
are
much
better
at
pricing
stock
options
or
designing
auctions
than
economists
were
even
a
generation
ago
An
equally
radical
but
opposite
reaction
is
Deirdre
McCloskey’s
who
denies
that
there
are
any
non-trivial
methodological
standards
that
economics
must
meet

2000
McCloskey
and
Ziliak
2003
Ziliak
and
McCloskey
2008
In
her
view
the
only
relevant
and
significant
criteria
for
assessing
the
practices
and
products
of
a
discipline
are
those
accepted
by
the
practitioners
Apart
from
a
few
general
standards
such
as
honesty
and
a
willingness
to
listen
to
criticisms
the
only
justifiable
criteria
for
any
conversation
are
those
of
the
participants
Economists
can
thus
dismiss
the
arrogant
pretensions
of
philosophers
to
judge
economic
discourse
Whatever
a
group
of
respected
economists
takes
to
be
good
economics
is
automatically
good
economics
Philosophical
standards
of
empirical
success
are
just
so
much
hot
air
Those
who
are
interested
in
understanding
the
character
of
economics
and
in
contributing
to
its
improvement
should
eschew
methodology
and
study
instead
the
rhetoric
of
economics
that
is
the
means
of
argument
and
persuasion
that
succeed
among
economists
McCloskey’s
studies
of
the
rhetoric
of
economics
have
been
valuable
and
influential
1985
esp
ch
5

McCloskey
and
Ziliak
2003
Ziliak
and
McCloskey
2008
but
a
great
deal
of
her
work
during
the
1980
s
and
1990
s
consists
of
philosophical
critiques
of
economic
methodology
rather
than
studies
of
the
rhetoric
of
economics
Her
philosophical
critiques
are
problematic
because
the
position
sketched
in
the
previous
paragraph
is
hard
to
defend
and
potentially
self-defeating
It
is
hard
to
defend
because
epistemological
standards
have
already
influenced
the
conversation
of
economists
The
standards
of
predictive
success
which
lead
one
to
have
qualms
about
economics
are
already
standards
that
many
economists
accept
The
only
way
to
escape
these
doubts
is
to
surrender
the
standards
that
gave
rise
to
them
But
McCloskey’s
position
undermines
any
principled
argument
for
a
change
in
standards
Furthermore
as
Rosenberg
has
argued
1988
it
seems
that
economists
would
doom
themselves
to
irrelevance
if
they
were
to
surrender
standards
of
predictive
success
for
it
is
upon
such
standards
that
policy
decisions
are
made
McCloskey
does
not
in
fact
want
to
preclude
the
possibiity
that
economists
are
sometimes
persuaded
when
they
should
not
be
or
are
not
persuaded
when
they
should
be
For
she
herself
criticizes
the
bad
habit
some
economists
have
of
conflating
statistical
significance
with
economic
importance

McCloskey
and
Ziliak

Ziliak
and
McCloskey
2008
McCloskey
typically
characterizes
rhetoric
descriptively
as
the
study
of
what
in
fact
persuades
but
sometimes
she
instead
characterizes
it
normatively
as
the
study
of
what
ought
to
persuade
1985
ch
2
And
if
rhetoric
is
the
study
of
what
ought
rationally
to
persuade
then
it
is
methodology
not
an
alternative
to
methodology
Questions
about
whether
economics
is
a
successful
empirical
science
cannot
be
conjured
away

Realism
in
economic
methodology
Economic
methodologist
have
paid
little
attention
to
debates
within
philosophy
of
science
between
realists
and
anti-realists

Fraassen
1980
Boyd
1984
Psillos

because
economic
theories
rarely
postulate
the
existence
of
unobservable
entities
or
properties
apart
from
variants
of
everyday
unobservables
such
as
beliefs
and
desires
Methodologists
have
on
the
other
hand
vigorously
debated
the
goals
of
economics
but
those
who
argue
that
the
ultimate
goals
are
predictive
such
as
Milton
Friedman
do
so
because
of
their
interest
in
policy
not
because
they
seek
to
avoid
or
resolve
epistemological
and
semantic
puzzles
concerning
references
to
unobservables
Nevertheless
there
are
two
important
recent
realist
programs
in
economic
methodology
The
first
developed
mainly

The
second

is
espoused
by

Lawson
and
his
co-workers
mainly
at

from

In
Lawson’s
view
one
can
trace
many
of
the
inadequacies
of
mainstream
economics
of
which
he
is
a
critic
to
an
insufficient
concern
with
ontology
In
attempting
to
identify
regularities
on
the
surface
of
the
phenomena
mainstream
economists
are
doomed
to
failure
Economic
phenomena
are
in
fact
influenced
by
a
large
number
of
different
causal
factors
and
one
can
achieve
scientific
knowledge
only
of
the
underlying
mechanisms
and
tendencies
whose
operation
can
be
glimpsed
intermittently
and
obscurely
in
observable
relations
Mäki’s
and
Lawson’s
programs
have
little
to
do
with
one
another
though
Mäki
like
Mill
Cartwright
and
Hausman
shares
Lawson’s
and
Bhaskar’s
concern
with
underlying
causal
mechanisms

Economic
methodology
and
social
studies
of
science
Throughout
its
history
economics
has
been
the
subject
of
sociological
as
well
as
methodological
scrutiny
Many
sociological
discussions
of
economics
like
Marx’s
critique
of
classical
political
economy
have
been
concerned
to
identify
ideological
distortions
and
thereby
to
criticize
particular
aspects
of
economic
theory
and
economic
policy
Since
every
political
program
finds
economists
who
testify
to
its
economic
virtues
there
is
a
never-ending
source
of
material
for
such
critiques
For
example
in
the
wake
of
the
near
collapse
of
the
international
financial
system
in
2008
American
economists
who
argued
for
austerity
were
mostly
Republicans
while
those
who
defended
efforts
to
increase
aggregate
demand
were
mostly
Democrats
The
influence
of
contemporary
sociology
of
science
and
social
studies
of
science
coupled
with
the
difficulties
methodologists
have
had
making
sense
of
and
rationalizing
the
conduct
of
economics
have
led
to
efforts
at
fusing
economics
and
sociology

as
well
as
to
a
sociological
turn
within
methodological
reflection
itself
Rather
than
showing
that
there
is
good
evidence
supporting
developments
in
economic
theory
or
that
those
developments
have
other
broadly
epistemic
virtues
methodologists
and
historians
such
as
D
Wade
Hands
2001
Hands
and
Mirowski
1998
Philip
Mirowski
1990
2002
2004
2013
and
E
Roy
Weintraub
1991
have
argued
that
these
changes
reflect
a
wide
variety
of
non-rational
factors
from
changes
in
funding
for
theoretical
economics
political
commitments
personal
rivalries
attachments
to
metaphors
or
mathematical
interests
Furthermore
many
of
the
same
methodologists
and
historians
have
argued
that
economics
is
not
only
an
object
of
social
inquiry
but
that
it
can
be
a
tool
of
social
inquiry
into
science
By
studying
the
incentive
structure
of
scientific
disciplines
and
the
implicit
or
explicit
market
forces
impinging
on
research
including
of
course
research
in
economics
it
should
be
possible
to
write
the
economics
of
science
and
the
economics
of
economics
itself

how
if
at
all
this
work
is
supposed
to
bear
on
questions
concerning
how

make
is
not
clear
Though
eschewing
traditional
methodology
Mirowski’s
monograph
on
the
role
of
physical
analogy
in
economics
1990
is
often
very
critical
of
mainstream
economics
In
his
Reflection
without
Rules
2001
D
W
Hands
maintains
that
general
methodological
rules
are
of
little
use
He
defends
a
naturalistic
view
of
methodology
and
is
skeptical
of
prescriptions
that
are
not
based
on
detailed
knowledge
But
he
does
not
argue
that
no
rules
apply

The

the
fundamental
problems

The
above
discussion
documents
the
diversity
and
disagreements
concerning
how
to
interpret
and
appraise
economic
theories
It
is
not
surprising
that
there
is
no
consensus
among
those
writing
on
economic
methodology
concerning
the
overall
empirical
appraisal
of
specific
approaches
in
economics
including
mainstream
microeconomics
macroeconomics
and
econometrics
When
practitioners
cannot
agree
it
is
questionable
whether
those
who
know
more
philosophy
but
less
economics
will
be
able
to
settle
the
matter
Since
the
debates
continue
those
who
reflect
on
economic
methodology
should
have
a
continuing
part
to
play
Meanwhile
there
are
many
other
more
specific
methodological
questions
to
address
and
it
is
a
sign
of
the
maturity
of
the
subdiscipline
that
a
large
and
increasing
percentage
of
work
on
economic
methodology
addresses
more
specific
questions
There
is
plethora
of
work
as
a
perusal
of
any
recent
issue
of
the
Journal
of
Economic
Methodology
or
Economics
and
Philosophy
will
confirm
Some
of
the
range
of
issues
currently
under
discussion
were
mentioned
above
in
Section
2
Here
is
a
list
of
three
of
the
many
areas
of
current
interest
1
Although
more
concerned
with
the
content
of
economics
than
with
its
methodology
the
recent
explosion
of
work
on
feminist
economics
is
shot
through
with
methodological
and
sociological
self-reflection
The
fact
that
a
considerably
larger
percentage
of
economists
are
men
than
is
true
of
any
of
the
other
social
sciences
and
indeed
than
most
of
the
natural
sciences
raises
questions
about
whether
there
is
something
particularly
masculine
about
the
discipline

Since
1995
there
has
been
a
journal
Feminist
Economics
which
pulls
together
much
of
this
work
2
During
the
past
decades
laboratory
experimentation
in
economics
has
expanded
rapidly
Laboratory
experimentation
has
many
different
objectives
see
Roth
1988
and
apparently
holds
out
the
prospect
of
bridging
the
gulf
between
fundamental
economic
theory
and
empirical
evidence
Some
of
it
casts
light
on
the
way
in
which
methodological
commitments
influence
the
extent
to
which
economists
heed
empirical
evidence
A
good
deal
of
laboratory
experimentation
in
contemporary
economics
is
in
the
service
of
behavioral
economics
which
prides
itself
on
heeding
experimental
evidence
concerning
the
structure
and
determinants
of
individual
choices
Although
behavioral
economics
has
secured
a
foothold
within
mainstream
economics
it
remains
controversial
substantively
and
methodologically
and
its
implications
for
normative
economics
discussed
below
in
section
6
are
controversial
For
example
in
the
case
of
preference
reversals
discussed
briefly
below
in
Section
5
1
economists
devoted
considerable
attention
to
the
experimental
findings
and
conceded
that
they
disconfirmed
central
principles
of
economics
But
economists
have
been
generally
unwilling
to
pay
serious
attention
to
the
theories
proposed
by
psychologists
that
predicted
the
phenomena
before
they
were
observed
The
reason
seems
to
be
that
these
psychological
theories
do
not
have
the
same
wide
scope
as
the
basic
principles
of
mainstream
economics

In
an
extremely
influential
essay
The
Case
for
Mindless
Economics
Gul
and
Pesandorfer
2008
argue
that
the
findings
of
behavioral
economics
and
neuroeconomics
are
irrelevant
to
economics
They
are
at
most
of
heuristic
value
They
maintain
that
the
findings
of
behavioral
economics
are
irrelevant
to
economics
because
they
do
not
concern
market
choices
and
their
consequences
which
are
the
only
germane
data
Sometimes
Gul
and
Pesandorfer
appear
to
identify
economic
theory
with
the
empirical
consequences
economists
are
concerned
with
while
at
other
points
they
echo
Milton
Friedman
see
section
3
2
and
deny
that
the
realism
of
the
assumptions
of
economic
models
matters
They
do
not
address
sophisticated
defenses
of
realism
concerning
mental
states
like
Dietrich
and
List
2016
It
seems
to
me
that
theoretical
resistance
to
engaging
with
behavioral
economists
like
that
one
finds
in
Gul
and
Pesandorfer’s
essay
is
weakening
But
it
is
clear
that
the
methodological
commitments
governing
theoretical
economics
are
much
more
complex
and
more
specific
to
economics
than
the
general
rules
proposed
by
philosophers
such
as
Popper
and
Lakatos
The
relevance
of
laboratory
experimentation
remains
controversial
Behavioral
economists
are
enthusiastic
while
more
traditional
theorists
question
whether
experimental
findings
can
be
generalized
to
non-experimental
contexts
and
more
generally
concerning
the
possibilities
of
learning
from
experiments

During

generation
there
has
been
a
radical
transformation
in
the
attitudes
of
economists
toward
empirical
causal
inquiry
especially
in
the
form
of
field
experiments
and
natural
experiments
often
employing
instrumental
variables

example
about
two-thirds
of
the
articles
in
the

Economic

are
based
on
empirical
studies

appear
to
be
hard-nosed
inquiries
that
establish

simple

easy

intervention
that
works
splendidly
at
a
specific
time

place
to
fail
abysmally
when
tried
elsewhere
Atheoretical
inquiry
even
when
methodologically
sophisticated
has
severe
limits
as
a
tactic
of
knowledge
acquisition
The
empirical
turn
in
economics
has
also
had
the
effect
of
increasing
the
importance
of
economic
history
With
some
ingenuity
especially
in
identifying
possible
instrumental
variables
history
is
full
of
natural
experiments
For
example
J
Hausman
2016
in
1936
the
American
Congress
voted
to
pay
pensions
to
veterans
of
World
War
I
eight
years
before
they
were
due
to
be
paid
Because
the
percentages
of
veterans
differed
across
states
Hausman
can
use
the
differing
economic
performances
of
states
to
estimate
the
effects
of
the
economic
stimulus
the
pensions
provided
Although
less
decisive
than
randomized
controlled
trials
which
are
often
impossible
to
carry
out
examination
of
historical
episodes
such
as
this
one
provide
significant
evidence
concerning
economic
hypotheses
5
Rational
choice
theory
Insofar
as
economics
explains
and
predicts
phenomena
as
consequences
of
individual
choices
which
are
themselves
explained
in
terms
of
alleged
reasons
it
must
depict
agents
as
to
some
extent
rational
Rationality
like
reasons
involves
evaluation
and
just
as
one
can
assess
the
rationality
of
individual
choices
so
one
can
assess
the
rationality
of
social
choices
and
examine
how
they
are
and
ought
to
be
related
to
the
preferences
and
judgments
of
individuals
In
addition
there
are
intricate
questions
concerning
rationality
in
strategic
situations
in
which
outcomes
depend
on
the
choices
of
multiple
individuals
Since
rationality
is
a
central
concept
in
branches
of
philosophy
such
as
action
theory
epistemology
ethics
and
philosophy
of
mind
studies
of
rationality
frequently
cross
the
boundaries
between
economics
and
philosophy
5
1
Individual
rationality
The
barebones
theory
of
rationality
discussed
above
in
Section
1
1
takes
an
agent’s
preferences
rankings
of
states
of
affairs
to
be
rational
if
they
are
complete
and
transitive
and
it
takes
the
agent’s
choice
to
be
rational
if
the
agent
does
not
prefer
any
feasible
alternative
to
the
one
he
or
she
chooses
Such
a
theory
of
rationality
is
clearly
too
weak
because
it
says
nothing
about
belief
or
what
rationality
implies
when
agents
do
not
know
with
certainty
everything
relevant
to
their
choices
But
it
may
also
be
too
strong
since
as
Isaac
Levi
in
particular
has
argued
1986
there
is
nothing
irrational
about
having
incomplete
preferences
in
situations
involving
uncertainty
Sometimes
it
is
rational
to
suspend
judgment
and
to
refuse
to
rank
alternatives
that
are
not
well
understood
On
the
other
hand
transitivity
is
a
plausible
condition
and
the
so-called
money
pump
argument
demonstrates
that
if
one’s
preferences
are
intransitive
and
one
is
willing
to
make
exchanges
then
one
can
be
exploited
Suppose
an
agent
A
prefers
X
to
Y
Y
to
Z
and
Z
to
X
and
that
A
will
pay
some
small
amount
of
money
P
to
exchange
Y
for
X
Z
for
Y
and
X
for
Z
That
means
that
starting
with
Z
A
will
pay
P
for
Y
then
P
again
for
X
then
P
again
for
Z
and
so
on
Agents
are
not
this
stupid
They
will
instead
refuse
to
trade
or
adjust
their
preferences
to
eliminate
the
intransitivity
but
see
Schick
1986
On
the
other
hand
there
is
considerable
experimental
evidence
that
people’s
preferences
are
not
in
fact
transitive
Such
evidence
does
not
establish
that
transitivity
is
not
a
requirement
of
rationality
It
may
show
instead
that
people
are
sometimes
irrational
In
the
case
of
so-called
preference
reversals
for
example
it
seems
plausible
that
people
in
fact
make
irrational
choices
Lichtenstein
and
Slovic
1971
Tversky
and
Thaler
1990
Evidence
of
persistent
violations
of
transitivity
is
disquieting
since
standards
of
rationality
should
not
be
impossibly
high
A
further
difficulty
with
the
barebones
theory
of
rationality
concerns
the
individuation
of
the
objects
of
preference
or
choice
Consider
for
example
data
from
multistage
ultimatum
games
Suppose
A
can
propose
any
division
of
10
between
A
and
B
B
can
accept
or
reject
A’s
proposal
If
B
rejects
the
proposal
then
the
amount
of
money
drops
to
5
and
B
gets
to
offer
a
division
of
the
5
which
A
can
accept
or
reject
If
A
rejects
B’s
offer
then
both
players
get
nothing
Suppose
that
A
proposes
to
divide
the
money
with
7
for
A
and
3
for
B
B
declines
and
offers
to
split
the
5
evenly
with
2
50
for
each
Behavior
such
as
this
is
in
fact
common
Ochs
and
Roth
1989
p
362
Assuming
that
B
prefers
more
money
to
less
these
choices
appear
to
be
a
violation
of
transitivity
B
prefers
3
to
2
50
yet
declines
3
for
certain
for
2
50
with
some
slight
chance
of
A
declining
and
B
getting
nothing
But
the
objects
of
choice
are
not
just
quantities
of
money
B
is
turning
down
3
as
part
of
a
raw
deal
in
favor
of
2
50
as
part
of
a
fair
arrangement
If
the
objects
of
choice
are
defined
in
this
way
there
is
no
failure
of
transitivity
This
plausible
observation
gives
rise
to
a
serious
problem
Unless
there
are
constraints
on
how
the
objects
of
choice
are
individuated
conditions
of
rationality
such
as
transitivity
are
empty
A’s
choice
of
X
over
Y
Y
over
Z
and
Z
over
X
does
not
violate
transitivity
if
X
when
the
alternative
is
Y
is
not
the
same
object
of
choice
as
X
when
the
alternative
is
Z
John
Broome
1991
argues
that
further
substantive
principles
of
rationality
are
required
to
limit
how
alternatives
are
individuated
or
to
require
that
agents
be
indifferent
between
alternatives
such
as
X
when
the
alternative
is
Y
and
X
when
the
alternative
is
Z
To
extend
the
theory
of
rationality
to
circumstances
involving
risk
where
the
objects
of
choice
are
lotteries
with
known
probabilities
and
uncertainty
where
agents
do
not
know
the
probabilities
or
even
all
the
possible
outcomes
of
their
choices
requires
further
principles
of
rationality
as
well
as
controversial
technical
simplifications
Subjective
Bayesians
suppose
that
individuals
in
circumstances
of
uncertainty
have
well-defined
subjective
probabilities
degrees
of
belief
over
all
the
payoffs
and
thus
that
the
objects
of
choice
can
be
modeled
as
lotteries
just
as
in
circumstances
involving
risk
though
with
subjective
probabilities
in
place
of
objective
probabilities
See
the
entries
on
Bayes
theorem
and
Bayesian
epistemology
The
most
important
of
the
axioms
needed
for
the
theory
of
rational
choice
under
conditions
of
risk
and
uncertainty
is
the
independence
condition
It
says
roughly
that
the
preferences
of
rational
agent
between
two
lotteries
that
differ
in
only
one
outcome
should
match
their
preferences
between
the
differing
outcomes
Although
initially
plausible
the
independence
condition
is
very
controversial
See
Allais
and
Hagen
1979
and
McClennen
1983
1990
A
considerable
part
of
rational
choice
theory
is
concerned
with
formalizations
of
conditions
of
rationality
and
investigation
of
their
implications
When
an
agent’s
preferences
are
complete
and
transitive
and
satisfy
a
further
continuity
condition
then
they
can
be
represented
by
a
so-called
ordinal
utility
function
What
this
means
is
that
it
is
possible
to
define
a
function
that
represents
an
agent’s
preferences
so
that
U(X
U(Y
if
and
only
if
the
agent
prefers
X
to
Y
and
U(X
U(Y
if
and
only
if
the
agent
is
indifferent
between
X
and
Y
This
function
merely
represents
the
preference
ranking
It
contains
no
information
beyond
the
ranking
Any
order-preserving
transformation
of
U
would
represent
the
agent’s
preferences
just
as
well
When
an
agent’s
preferences
in
addition
satisfy
the
independence
condition
and
some
other
technical
conditions
then
they
can
be
represented
by
an
expected
utility
function
Harsanyi
1977
b
ch
4
Hernstein
and
Milnor
1953
Ramsey
1926
and
Savage
1972
Such
a
function
has
two
important
properties
First
the
expected
utility
of
a
lottery
is
equal
to
the
sum
of
the
expected
utilities
of
its
prizes
weighted
by
their
probabilities
Second
expected
utility
functions
are
unique
up
to
a
positive
affine
transformation
What
this
means
is
that
if
U
and
V
are
both
expected
utility
functions
representing
the
preferences
of
an
agent
then
for
all
objects
of
preference
X
V(X
must
be
equal
to
aU(X
b
where
a
and
b
are
real
numbers
and
a
is
positive
In
addition
the
axioms
of
rationality
imply
that
the
agent’s
degrees
of
belief
will
satisfy
the
axioms
of
the
probability
calculus
A
great
deal
of
controversy
surrounds
the
theory
of
rationality
and
there
have
been
many
formal
investigations
into
weakened
or
amended
theories
of
rationality

Collective
rationality
and
social
choice
Although
societies
are
very
different
from
individuals
they
have
mechanisms
to
evaluate
alternatives
and
make
choices
and
their
evaluations
and
choices
may
be
rational
or
irrational
It
is
not
however
obvious
what
principles
of
rationality
should
govern
the
choices
and
evaluations
of
society
Transitivity
is
one
plausible
condition
It
seems
that
a
society
that
chooses
X
when
faced
with
the
alternatives
X
or
Y
Y
when
faced
with
the
alternatives
Y
or
Z
and
Z
when
faced
with
the
alternatives
X
or
Z
either
has
had
a
change
of
heart
or
is
choosing
irrationally
Yet
purported
irrationalities
such
as
these
can
easily
arise
from
standard
mechanisms
that
aim
to
link
social
choices
and
individual
preferences
Suppose
there
are
three
individuals
in
the
society
Individual
One
ranks
the
alternatives
X
Y
Z
Individual
Two
ranks
them
Y
Z
X
Individual
Three
ranks
them
Z
X
Y
If
decisions
are
made
by
pairwise
majority
voting
X
will
be
chosen
from
the
pair
X
Y
Y
will
be
chosen
from
Y
Z
and
Z
will
be
chosen
from
X
Z
Clearly
this
is
unsettling
but
are
possible
cycles
in
social
choices
irrational
Similar
problems
affect
what
one
might
call
the
logical
coherence
of
social
judgments
List
and
Pettit
2002
Suppose
society
consists
of
three
individuals
who
make
the
following
judgments
concerning
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
propositions
P
and
Q
and
that
social
judgment
follows
the
majority
P
if
P
then
Q
Q
Individual
1
true
true
true
Individual
2
false
true
false
Individual
3
true
false
false
Society

true
false
The
judgments
of
each
of
the
individuals
are
consistent
with
the
principles
of
logic
while
social
judgments
violate
them
How
important
is
it
that
social
judgments
be
consistent
with
the
principles
of
logic
Although
social
choice
theory
in
this
way
bears
on
questions
of
social
rationality
most
work
in
social
choice
theory
explores
the
consequences
of
principles
of
rationality
coupled
with
explicitly
ethical
constraints
The
seminal
contribution
is
Kenneth
Arrow’s
impossibility
theorem
1963
1967
Arrow
assumes
that
both
individual
preferences
and
social
preferences
are
complete
and
transitive
and
that
the
method
of
forming
social
preferences
or
making
social
choices
issues
in
some
social
preference
ranking
or
social
choice
for
any
possible
profile
of
individual
preferences
In
addition
Arrow
imposes
a
weak
unanimity
condition
if
everybody
prefers
X
to
Y
then
Y
must
not
be
socially
preferred
Third
he
requires
that
there
be
no
dictator
whose
preferences
determine
social
preferences
or
choices
irrespective
of
the
preferences
of
anybody
else
Lastly
he
imposes
the
condition
that
the
social
preference
between
X
and
Y
should
depend
on
how
individuals
rank
X
and
Y
and
on
nothing
else
Arrow
then
proved
the
surprising
result
that
no
method
of
relating
social
and
individual
preferences
can
satisfy
all
these
conditions
In
the
sixty
years
since
Arrow
wrote
there
has
been
a
plethora
of
work
in
social
choice
theory
a
good
deal
of
which
is
arguably
of
great
importance
to
ethics
For
example
John
Harsanyi
proved
that
if
individual
preferences
and
social
evaluations
both
satisfy
the
axioms
of
expected
utility
theory
with
shared
or
objective
probabilities
and
that
social
preferences
conform
to
unanimous
individual
preferences
then
social
evaluations
are
determined
by
a
weighted
sum
of
individual
utilities
1955
1977
a
Matthew
Adler
2012
has
extended
an
approach
like
Harsanyi’s
to
demonstrate
that
a
form
of
weighted
utilitarianism
which
prioritizes
the
interests
of
those
who
are
worse
off
uniquely
satisfies
a
longer
list
of
rational
and
ethical
constraints
When
there
are
instead
disagreements
in
probability
assignments
there
is
an
impossibility
result
the
unanimity
condition
implies
that
for
some
profiles
of
individual
preferences
social
evaluations
will
not
satisfy
the
axioms
of
expected
utility
theory

Game
theory
When
outcomes
depend
on
what
several
agents
do
one
agent’s
best
choice
may
depend
on
what
other
agents
choose
Although
the
principles
of
rationality
governing
individual
choice
still
apply
arguably
there
are
further
principles
of
rationality
governing
expectations
of
the
actions
of
others
and
of
their
expectations
concerning
your
actions
and
expectations
and
so
forth
Game
theory
occupies
an
increasingly
important
role
within

relevant
both
to
inquiries
concerning

inquiries
concerning

Economics
and
ethics
As
discussed
above
in
Section
2
1
most
economists
distinguish
between
positive
and
normative
economics
and
most
would
argue
that
economics
is
relevant
to
policy
mainly
because
of
the
positive
information
it
provides
concerning
the
consequences
of
policy
Yet
the
same
economists
also
offer
their
advice
concerning
how
to
fix
the
economy
and
there
is
a
whole
field
of
normative
economics
Economic
outcomes
institutions
and
processes
may
be
better
or
worse
in
several
different
ways
Some
outcomes
may
make
people
better
off
Other
outcomes
may
be
less
unequal
Others
may
restrict
individual
freedom
more
severely
Economists
typically
evaluate
outcomes
exclusively
in
terms
of
welfare
This
does
not
imply
that
they
believe
that
only
welfare
is
of
moral
importance
They
focus
on
welfare
because
they
believe
that
economics
provides
an
excellent
set
of
tools
to
address
questions
of
welfare
and
because
they
hope
that
questions
about
welfare
can
be
separated
from
questions
about
equality
freedom
or
justice
As
sketched
below
economists
have
had
some
things
to
say
about
other
dimensions
of
moral
appraisal
but
welfare
takes
center
stage
Indeed
normative
economics
is
standardly
called
welfare
economics
6
1
Welfare
One
central
question
of
moral
philosophy
has
been
to
determine
what
things
are
intrinsically
good
for
human
beings
This
is
a
central
question
because
all
plausible
moral
views
assign
an
important
place
to
individual
welfare
or
well-being
This
is
obviously
true
of
utilitarianism
which
holds
that
what
is
right
maximizes
total
or
average
welfare
but
even
non-utilitarian
views
are
concerned
with
welfare
if
they
recognize
the
virtue
of
benevolence
or
if
they
are
concerned
with
the
interests
of
individuals
or
with
avoiding
harm
to
individuals
There
are
many
ways
to
think
about
well-being
and
the
prevailing
view
among
economists
has
shifted
from
hedonism
which
takes
the
good
to
be
a
mental
state
such
as
pleasure
or
happiness
to
the
view
that
welfare
should
be
measured
by
the
satisfaction
of
preferences
A
number
of
prominent
economists
are
currently
arguing
for
a
return
to
hedonism
but
they
remain
a
minority

Unlike
hedonism
taking
welfare
to
be
preference
satisfaction
specifies
how
to
find
out
what
is
good
for
a
person
rather
than
committing
itself
to
any
substantive
view
of
a
person’s
good
Note
that
equating
welfare
with
the
satisfaction
of
preferences
is
not
equating
welfare
with
any
feeling
of
satisfaction
If
welfare
can
be
measured
by
the
satisfaction
of
preferences
then
a
person
is
better
off
if
what
he
or
she
prefers
comes
to
pass
regardless
of
whether
that
occurrence
makes
the
agent
feel
satisfied
Since
mainstream
economics
attributes
a
consistent
preference
ordering
to
all
agents
and
since
more
specific
models
typically
take
agents
to
be
well-informed
and
self-interested
it
is
easy
for
economists
to
accept
the
view
that
an
individual
agent
A
will
prefer
X
to
Y
if
and
only
if
X
is
in
fact
better
for
A
than
Y
is
This
is
one
place
where
positive
theory
bleeds
into
normative
theory
In
addition
the
identification
of
welfare
with
the
satisfaction
of
preferences
is
attractive
to
economists
because
it
prevents
questions
about
the
justification
of
paternalism
to
which
most
economists
are
strongly
opposed
from
even
arising
Welfare
and
the
satisfaction
of
preferences
may
coincide
because
the
satisfaction
of
preferences
constitutes
welfare
or
because
people
are
self-interested
and
good
judges
of
their
own
interests
and
hence
prefer
what
is
good
for
them
There
are
many
obvious
objections
to
the
view
that
the
satisfaction
of
preferences
constitutes
welfare
Preferences
may
be
based
on
mistaken
beliefs
People
may
prefer
to
sacrifice
their
own
well-being
for
some
purpose
they
value
more
highly
Preferences
may
reflect
past
manipulation
or
distorting
psychological
influences
Elster
1983
In
addition
if
preference
satisfaction
constitutes
welfare
then
policy
makers
can
make
people
better
off
by
molding
their
wants
rather
than
by
improving
conditions
Furthermore
it
seems
unreasonable
that
social
policy
should
attend
to
extravagant
preferences
Rather
than
responding
to
these
objections
and
attempting
to
defend
the
view
that
preference
satisfaction
constitutes
well-being
economists
can
blunt
these
objections
by
taking
preferences
in
circumstances
where
people
are
self-interested
and
good
judges
of
their
interests
to
be
merely
good
evidence
of
what
will
promote
welfare
Hausman
and
McPherson
2009
Hausman
2012
There
are
some
exceptions
most
notably
Amartya
Sen
1987
a,b,c
1992
but
most
economists
take
welfare
to
coincide
with
the
satisfaction
of
preference
6
2
Efficiency
Because
the
identification
of
welfare
with
preference
satisfaction
makes
it
questionable
whether
one
can
make
interpersonal
welfare
comparisons
few
economists
defend
a
utilitarian
view
of
policy
as
maximizing
total
or
average
welfare
Harsanyi
is
one
exception
for
another
see
Ng
1983
Economists
have
instead
explored
the
possibility
of
making
welfare
assessments
of
economic
processes
institutions
outcomes
and
policies
without
making
interpersonal
comparisons
Consider
two
economic
outcomes
S
and
R
and
suppose
that
some
people
prefer
S
to
R
and
that
nobody
prefers
R
to
S
In
that
case
S
is
Pareto
superior
to
R
or
S
is
a
Pareto
improvement
over
R
Without
making
any
interpersonal
comparisons
one
can
conclude
that
people’s
preferences
are
better
satisfied
in
S
than
in
R
If
there
is
no
state
of
affairs
that
is
Pareto
superior
to
S
then
economists
say
that
S
is
Pareto
optimal
or
Pareto
efficient
Efficiency
here
is
efficiency
with
respect
to
satisfying
preferences
rather
than
minimizing
the
number
of
inputs
needed
to
produce
a
unit
of
output
or
some
other
technical
notion
Le
Grand
1991
If
a
state
of
affairs
is
not
Pareto
efficient
then
society
is
missing
an
opportunity
costlessly
to
satisfy
some
people’s
preferences
better
A
Pareto
efficient
state
of
affairs
avoids
this
failure
but
it
has
no
other
obvious
virtues
For
example
suppose
nobody
is
satiated
and
people
care
only
about
how
much
food
they
get
Consider
two
distributions
of
food
In
the
first
millions
are
starving
but
no
food
is
wasted
In
the
second
nobody
is
starving
but
some
food
is
wasted
The
first
is
Pareto
efficient
while
the
second
is
not
The
notions
of
Pareto
improvements
and
Pareto
efficiency
might
seem
useless
because
economic
policies
almost
always
have
both
winners
and
losers
Mainstream
economists
have
nevertheless
found
these
concepts
useful
in
two
ways
First
they
have
proved
two
theorems
concerning
properties
of
perfectly
competitive
equilibria
Arrow
1968
The
first
theorem
says
that
equilibria
in
perfectly
competitive
markets
are
Pareto
optimal
and
the
second
says
that
any
Pareto
optimal
allocation
with
whatever
distribution
of
income
policy
makers
might
prefer
can
be
achieved
as
a
perfectly
competitive
market
equilibrium
provided
that
one
begins
with
just
the
right
distribution
of
endowments
among
economic
agents
The
first
theorem
has
been
regarded
as
underwriting
Adam
Smith’s
view
of
the
invisible
hand
Arrow
and
Hahn
1971
preface
Hahn
1973
This
interpretation
is
problematic
because
no
economy
has
ever
been
or
will
ever
be
in
perfectly
competitive
equilibrium
The
second
theorem
provides
some
justification
for
the
normative
division
of
labor
economists
prefer
with
economists
concerned
about
efficiency
and
others
concerned
about
justice
The
thought
is
that
the
second
theorem
shows
that
theories
of
just
distribution
are
compatible
with
reliance
on
competitive
markets
The
two
fundamental
theorems
of
welfare
economics
go
some
way
toward
explaining
why
mainstream
economists
whether
they
support
laissez-faire
policies
or
government
intervention
to
remedy
market
imperfections
think
of
perfectly
competitive
equilibria
as
ideals
But
the
significance
of
the
theorems
is
debatable
since
actual
markets
differ
significantly
from
perfectly
competitive
markets
and
when
there
are
multiple
market
imperfections
the
theory
of
the
second
best
shows
that
fixing
some
of
the
imperfections
may
lead
the
society
away
from
a
perfectly
competitive
equilibrium
and
diminish
efficiency
and
welfare
rather
than
toward
one
Lipsey
and
Lancaster
1956

The
other
way
that
economists
have
found
to
extend
the
Pareto
efficiency
notions
leads
to
cost-benefit
analysis
which
is
a
practical
tool
for
policy
analysis

and

Suppose
that
S
is
not
a
Pareto
improvement
over
R
Some
members
of
the
society
would
be
losers
in
a
shift
from
R
to
S
Those
losers
prefer
R
to
S
but
there
are
enough
winners
enough
people
who
prefer
S
to
R
that
the
winners
could
compensate
the
losers
and
make
the
preference
for
S
S
with
compensation
paid
over
R
unanimous
S
is
a
potential
Pareto
improvement
over
R
In
other
terms
the
amount
of
money
the
winners
would
be
willing
to
pay
to
bring
about
the
change
is
larger
than
the
amount
of
money
the
losers
would
have
to
be
compensated
so
as
not
to
object
to
the
change
Economists
are
skeptical
about
what
one
learns
from
asking
people
how
much
they
would
be
willing
to
pay
and
they
attempt
instead
to
infer
how
much
individuals
are
willing
to
pay
indirectly
from
market
phenomena
When
S
is
a
potential
Pareto
improvement
over
R
there
is
said
to
be
a
net
benefit
to
the
policy
of
bringing
about
S
According
to
cost-benefit
analysis
among
eligible
policies
which
satisfy
legal
and
moral
constraints
one
should
other
things
being
equal
employ
the
one
with
the
largest
net
benefit
Note
that
the
compensation
is
entirely
hypothetical
Potential
Pareto
improvements
result
in
winners
and
losers
the
justice
or
injustice
of
which
is
irrelevant
to
cost-benefit
analysis
Justice
or
beneficence
may
require
that
the
society
do
something
to
mitigate
distributional
imbalances
Because
there
is
a
larger
pie
of
goods
and
services
to
satisfy
preferences
since
compensation
could
be
paid
and
everybody’s
preferences
better
satisfied
selecting
policies
with
the
greatest
net
benefit
serves
economic
efficiency
Hicks
1939
Kaldor
1939
Despite
the
practical
importance
of
cost-benefit
analysis
the
technique
and
the
justification
for
it
sketched
in
the
previous
paragraph
are
problematic
One
technical
difficulty
is
that
it
is
possible
for
S
to
be
a
potential
Pareto
improvement
over
R
and
for
R
to
be
a
potential
Pareto
improvement
over
S
Scitovsky
1941
Samuelson
1950
That
means
that
the
fact
that
S
is
a
potential
Pareto
improvement
over
R
does
not
imply
that
there
is
a
larger
economic
pie
in
S
than
in
R
because
there
cannot
of
course
be
a
larger
economic
pie
in
S
than
in
R
and
a
larger
economic
pie
in
R
than
in
S
A
second
problem
is
that
willingness
to
pay
for
some
policy
and
the
amount
one
would
require
in
compensation
if
one
opposes
the
policy
depend
on
how
much
wealth
one
has
as
well
as
on
one’s
attitude
to
the
policy
Cost-benefit
analysis
weights
the
preferences
of
the
rich
more
than
the
preferences
of
the
poor
Baker
1975
It
is
possible
to
compensate
roughly
for
the
effects
of
income
and
wealth
Harburger
1978
Fankhauser
et
al
1997
but
it
is
bothersome
to
do
so
and
cost-benefit
analysis
is
commonly
employed
without
any
adjustment
for
wealth
or
income
A
further
serious
difficulty
for
traditional
welfare
economics
which
has
been
as
it
were
hiding
in
plain
sight
is
the
fact
that
choices
are
imperfect
indicators
of
preferences
which
are
in
turn
imperfect
indicators
of
what
enhances
well-being
The
same
facts
that
show
that
preference
satisfaction
does
not
constitute
well-being
false
beliefs
lack
of
information
other-directed
and
non-rational
preferences
show
that
choices
and
preferences
are
sometimes
misleading
indicators
of
well-being
Moreover
once
one
recognizes
that
preferences
are
good
indicators
of
welfare
only
if
agents
are
good
judges
of
what
will
benefit
them
one
is
bound
to
recognize
that
agents
are
not
always
good
judges
of
what
will
benefit
themselves
even
when
they
have
all
the
information
they
need
In
some
contexts
these
problems
may
be
minor
For
example
people’s
preferences
among
new
automobiles
are
largely
self-interested
thoughtful
and
well-informed
In
other
contexts
such
as
environmental
protection
preferences
for
ignoring
the
problems
are
often
badly
informed
while
preferences
to
take
action
are
typically
not
self-interested
Either
way
popular
preferences
among
policies
to
address
environmental
problems
are
unlikely
to
be
a
good
guide
to
welfare
Ignoring
these
problems
has
been
a
great
convenience
to
normative
economics
If
what
people
choose
reveals
their
preferences
which
in
turn
indicate
what
is
good
for
them
then
as
noted
before
government
action
to
steer
someone’s
choices
can
never
make
that
person
better
off
and
so
questions
about
whether
to
endorse
paternalistic
policies
cannot
arise
But
whether
or
not
it
is
advisable
successful
paternalism
is
not
impossible
and
recent
work
by
behavioral
economists
which
document
a
wide
variety
of
systematic
deliberative
foibles
has
put
questions
concerning
paternalism
back
on
the
table
Ariely
2009
Kahneman
2011
Some
economists
have
searched
for
ways
to
identify
an
agent’s
true
preferences
as
described
by
Infante
et
al
2016
Others
have
argued
that
policy
makers
must
respect
the
preferences
of
agents
among
their
ends
or
objectives
while
overruling
preferences
among
means
when
these
are
distorted
by
bad
judgment
or
false
beliefs
Thaler
and
Sunstein
2008
Le
Grand
and
New
2015
Moreover
Thaler
and
Sunstein’s
proposal
that
government
explore
non-coercive
methods
of
influencing
people
to
make
better
choices
nudges
has
been
popular
among
policy
makers
and
has
arguably
shifted
philosophical
discussion
of
paternalism
away
from
Mill’s
1859
focus
on
avoiding
coercion

Other
directions
in
normative
economics
Although
welfare
economics
and
concerns
about
efficiency
dominate
normative
economics
they
do
not
exhaust
the
subject
and
in
collaboration
with
philosophers
economists
have
made
important
contributions
to
contemporary
work
in
ethics
and
normative
social
and
political
philosophy
Section

and
Section

gave
some
hint
of
the
contributions
of
social
choice
theory
and
game
theory
In
addition
economists
and
philosophers
have
worked
on
the
problem
of
providing
a
formal
characterization
of
freedom
so
as
to
bring
tools
of
economic
analysis
to
bear

Others
have

of
social

functions
that
prioritize
the
interests
of
those
who
are
less
well
off
or
that
favor

of
resources
opportunity
and
outcomes

and
social
responsibility

inequalities

Conclusions
The
frontiers
between
economics
and
philosophy
concerned
with
methodology
rationality
ethics
and
normative
social
and
political
philosophy
are
buzzing
with
activity
This
activity
is
diverse
and
concerned
with
very
different
questions
Although
many
of
these
are
related
philosophy
of
economics
is
not
a
single
unified
enterprise
It
is
a
collection
of
separate
inquiries
linked
to
one
another
by
connections
among
the
questions
and
by
the
dominating
influence
of
mainstream
economic
models
and
techniques

There
are
now
a
large
number
of
blogs
by
prominent
economists
Though
not
predominantly
concerned
with
methodology
and
typically
not
exclusively
concerned
with
economics
these
blogs
show
economists
arguing
with
one
another
responding

reformulating
their

In
2018
Oxford
economist
Kate
Raworth
gave
an
interesting
TedX-talk
on
economic
growth
A
filled
to
capacity
auditorium
jumped
to
their
feet
when
she
finished
Her
point
of
departure
was
that
contemporary
thinking
on
human
prosperity
is
linked
to
economic
growth
like
an
airplane
that
after
takeoff
never
stops
climbing
For
politicians
and
economists
a
stagnating
or
retracting
economy
is
not
a
good
sign
and
Gross
Domestic
Product
GDP
is
a
strong
indicator
whether
the
economy
is
heading
in
the
right
direction
Today
the
sustainability
of
the
growth
logic
is
challenged
The
growth
dominant
logic
prevailed
in
the
1930
s
and
is
elegantly
discussed
in
a
book
from
1960
The
Stages
of
Economic
Growth
a
non-communist
manifesto
by
W.W
Rostoff
In
chapter
2
the
author
defines
five
stages
1
The
post-Newtonian
society
untouched
by
man’s
capability
of
regularly
manipulating
the
environment
to
his
advantage
2
The
pre-conditions
for
take-off
3
The
take-off
4
The
drive
to
maturity
5
The
age
of
high
mass-consumption
The
Swedish
activist
Gretha
Thunberg
made
us
painfully
aware
during
her
resent
UN-speech
that
we
are
currently
at
stage
5
a
stage
that
is
not
sustainable
Few
would
challenge
that
we
need
a
new
logic
for
economic
growth
Professor
Raworth
state
that
we
need
to
stay
within
the
boundaries
of
a
sweet
spot
where
people
thrive
For
all
to
thrive
some
have
to
give
Currently
too
many
economies
in
the
first
world
are
outside
the
boundaries
and
over-consume
the
world’s
resources
These
countries
must
reduce
economic
growth
At
the
same
time
millions
of
people
must
be
welcomed
into
the
sweet
spot
by
increasing
economic
growth
For
all
to
thrive
some
have
to
give
In
the
developed
world
there
is
a
movement
toward
3
Rs
Reuse
Recycle
and
Reduce
In
addition
I
can
see
four
initiatives
that
can
bring
us
closer
to
the
sweet
spot
increased
productivity
sharing
economy
circular
economy
and
innovations
Increased
productivity
When
more
firms
and
customers
can
do
more
with
less
we
have
increased
the
total
productivity
But
because
customers
input/output
ratio
is
not
estimated
it
is
hard
to
say
how
productivity
in
most
if
not
all
developed
economies
progress
Another
issue
is
that
several
of
the
leading
software
products
available
for
consumers
are
free
of
charge
e.g
Facebook
Google
etc
In
an
effort
to
estimate
the
value
of
free
software
for
consumers
Erik
Brynjolfsson
and
his
colleagues
at
MIT
developed
an
alternative
measure
for
economic
development
GDP-Benefits
for
consumers
Free
software
used
intensively
by
consumers
whose
input
e.g
time
or
output
e.g
benefits
is
not
measured
creates
a
productivity
measurement
challenge
If
you
cannot
measure
it
you
cannot
manage
it
Sharing
economy
Sharing
economy
is
carried
forward
by
a
wave
of
platform
companies
like
Lyft
Airbnb
and
TaskRabit
who
efficiently
and
effectively
connect
buyers
and
sellers
via
a
platform
The
basic
idea
behind
the
sharing
economy
is
to
better
utilize
unused
resources
like
time
and
assets
From
an
economic
growth
perspective
utilizing
free
unused
assets
may
increase
GDP
significantly
In
an
EU
28
report
they
found
that
GDP
could
theoretically
increase
by
EUR
572
billions
each
year
in
the
region
simply
by
utilizing
free
resources
more
effectively
Today
we
see
several
providers
turning
their
goods
products
into
a
service
like
cars
as
a
service
Circular
economy
Circular
economy
is
in
the
vogue
as
more
consumers
and
leaders
realize
that
the
old
linear
value
chain
production-distribution-consumption-destruction
is
creating
a
lot
of
waste
and
is
no
longer
sustainable
Circular
economy
is
rethinking
the
entire
process
and
every
component
of
any
good
or
service
with
a
view
to
bring
it
back
into
productive
usage
later
The
end-result
is
reduced
waste
A
Norwegian
provider
of
asphalt
changed
his
b-model
from
linear
to
circular
by
leasing
the
asphalt
to
local
authorities
collecting
it
after
two
to
three
years
refurbishing
the
asphalt
before
putting
it
back
The
new
mantra
is
One
party’s
waste
is
another
party’s
raw
material
Innovations
Innovations
are
the
mother
of
all
progress
more
often
than
not
driven
by
technology
For
service-oriented
firms
technology
has
given
us
self-service
technology
enabling
customers
to
serve
them
self
without
interacting
with
frontline
employees
Technology
has
put
smartphones
in
the
hands
of
consumers
and
given
them
tremendous
benefits
Technology
has
given
us
new
platform-based
business
models
and
services
that
have
challenged
the
incumbents
in
numerous
industries
5
G

Internet
of
Things
IoT
will
enable
firms
to
collect
vast
amounts
of
data
to
be
used
for
predictions
decisions
making
and
innovations
The
challenge
is
to
better
commercialize
inventions
and
scale
firms
Toward
the
economic
sweet
spot
In
Norway
Sweden
and
in
the
USA
we
measure
customers
perception
of
numerous
commercial
and
social
innovations
based
on
the
same
methodology
developed
at
NHH

of

are

logic
First
they
provide
customers
with
innovations
that
they
perceive
as
valuable
Second
they
contribute
to

through
their
green

making
them

which
is

Dynamic
Many
Valued
Logic
Systems
in
Theoretical
Economics
D
Lu
Abstract
This
paper
is
an
original
attempt
to
understand
the
foundations
of
economic
reasoning
It
endeavors
to
rigorously
define
the
relationship
between
subjective
interpretations
and
objective
valuations
of
such
interpretations
in
the
context
of
theoretical
economics
This
analysis
is
substantially
expanded
through
a
dynamic
approach
where
the
truth
of
a
valuation
results
in
an
updated
interpretation
or
changes
in
the
agent's
subjective
belief
regarding
the
effectiveness
of
the
selected
action
as
well
as
the
objective
reality
of
the
effectiveness
of
all
other
possible
actions
i.e
consequence
realization
Complications
arise
when
the
economic
agent
is
presented
with
a
set
of
actions
that
render
ambiguous
preference
or
when
the
effectiveness
of
an
action
cannot
be
perceived
upon
its
selection
thereby
necessitating
a
different
theory
of
choice
and
consequence
realization

With
AI
logic
programming
tl;dr
Logic
programming
is
a
type
of
programming
in
which
programmers
define
the
rules
of
the
program
in
the
form
of
logical
statements
What
is
the
difference
between
logic
programming
and
other
AI
programming
paradigms
There
are
a
few
key
differences
between
logic
programming
and
other
AI
programming
paradigms
For
one
logic
programming
is
based
on
a
declarative
programming
paradigm
meaning
that
the
programmer
declares
what
the
program
should
do
rather
than
how
it
should
do
it
This
makes
logic
programming
programs
more
human-readable
and
easier
to
understand
Another
key
difference
is
that
logic
programming
is
based
on
formal
logic
whereas
other
AI
programming
paradigms
are
not
This
means
that
logic
programming
programs
can
take
advantage
of
the
many
powerful
inference
algorithms
that
have
been
developed
for
formal
logic
This
gives
logic
programming
a
significant
advantage
when
it
comes
to
solving
complex
problems
Finally
logic
programming
is
a
non-procedural
paradigm
meaning
that
programs
are
not
written
as
a
sequence
of
instructions
to
be
executed
This
makes
logic
programming
programs
more
flexible
and
easier
to
change
It
also
makes
them
more
resistant
to
errors
since
there
is
no
need
to
worry
about
the
order
in
which
instructions
are
executed
What
are
the
benefits
of
using
logic
programming
in
AI
applications
Logic
programming
is
a
powerful
tool
for
AI
applications
It
allows
for
the
concise
representation
of
knowledge
and
the
efficient
execution
of
inference
Logic
programming
has
been
used
in
a
wide
range
of
AI
applications
including
natural
language
processing
knowledge
representation
and
reasoning
planning
and
machine
learning
Logic
programming
has
several
advantages
over
other
AI
paradigms
First
logic
programs
are
declarative
meaning
that
they
specify
what
is
to
be
done
rather
than
how
it
is
to
be
done
This
makes
them
easier
to
understand
and
maintain
than
procedural
programs
Second
logic
programs
can
be
executed
efficiently
by
computers
Third
logic
programs
can
be
easily
extended
and
modified
Fourth
logic
programming
is
a
well-understood
paradigm
with
a
rich
theoretical
foundation
This
foundation
can
be
used
to
develop
new
AI
applications
and
to
understand
and
improve
existing
ones
Finally
logic
programming
is
well
suited
for
use
in
distributed
systems
such
as
the
World
Wide
Web
What
are
some
of
the
challenges
associated
with
logic
programming
Logic
programming
is
a
type
of
AI
that
is
based
on
formal
logic
This
means
that
it
is
based
on
a
set
of
rules
that
are
used
to
infer
new
information
Logic
programming
is
a
very
powerful
tool
for
AI
but
it
also
has
some
limitations
One
of
the
biggest
challenges
with
logic
programming
is
that
it
can
be
very
difficult
to
scale
This
is
because
the
number
of
rules
that
need
to
be
considered
grows
exponentially
as
the
size
of
the
problem
increases
This
can
make
it
very
difficult
to
solve
large
problems
with
logic
programming
Another
challenge
with
logic
programming
is
that
it
can
be
difficult
to
deal
with
uncertain
information
This
is
because
the
rules
that
are
used
to
infer
new
information
are
based
on
a
set
of
assumptions
that
may
not
be
true
in
all
cases
This
can
lead
to
incorrect
results
if
the
assumptions
are
not
valid
Overall
logic
programming
is
a
powerful
tool
for
AI
but
it
has
some
challenges
that
need
to
be
considered
These
challenges
can
be
overcome
with
careful
planning
and
design
but
they
need
to
be
kept
in
mind
when
using
logic
programming
for
AI
What
are
some
of
the
most
popular
logic
programming
languages
There
are
many
popular
logic
programming
languages
in
AI
but
some
of
the
most
popular
ones
are
Prolog
LISP
and
Clojure
Prolog
is
a
widely
used
language
for
artificial
intelligence
and
expert
systems
LISP
is
also
a
popular
language
for
AI
and
is
used
in
many
commercial
applications
Clojure
is
a
newer
language
that
is
gaining
popularity
for
its
powerful
features
and
concise
syntax
What
are
some
of
the
most
popular
applications
of
logic
programming
Logic
programming
is
a
type
of
programming
that
is
based
on
formal
logic
In
AI
logic
programming
is
used
for
knowledge
representation
and
reasoning
Logic
programming
can
be
used
for

In
this
chapter
we
will
focus
logic
programming
and
how
it
helps
in
Artificial
Intelligence
We
already
know
that
logic
is
the
study
of
principles
of
correct
reasoning
or
in
simple
words
it
is
the
study
of
what
comes
after
what
For
example
if
two
statements
are
true
then
we
can
infer
any
third
statement
from
it
Concept
Logic
Programming
is
the
combination
of
two
words
logic
and
programming
Logic
Programming
is
a
programming
paradigm
in
which
the
problems
are
expressed
as
facts
and
rules
by
program
statements
but
within
a
system
of
formal
logic
Just
like
other
programming
paradigms
like
object
oriented
functional
declarative
and
procedural
etc
it
is
also
a
particular
way
to
approach
programming
How
to
Solve
Problems
with
Logic
Programming
Logic
Programming
uses
facts
and
rules
for
solving
the
problem
That
is
why
they
are
called
the
building
blocks
of
Logic
Programming
A
goal
needs
to
be
specified
for
every
program
in
logic
programming
To
understand
how
a
problem
can
be
solved
in
logic
programming
we
need
to
know
about
the
building
blocks
Facts
and
Rules
Facts
Actually
every
logic
program
needs
facts
to
work
with
so
that
it
can
achieve
the
given
goal
Facts
basically
are
true
statements
about
the
program
and
data
For
example
Delhi
is
the
capital
of
India
Rules
Actually
rules
are
the
constraints
which
allow
us
to
make
conclusions
about
the
problem
domain
Rules
basically
written
as
logical
clauses
to
express
various
facts
For
example
if
we
are
building
any
game
then
all
the
rules
must
be
defined
Rules
are
very
important
to
solve
any
problem
in
Logic
Programming
Rules
are
basically
logical
conclusion
which
can
express
the
facts
Following
is
the
syntax
of
rule
A
B
1
B
2
B[n
Here
A
is
the
head
and
B
1
B
2
Bn
is
the
body
For
example
ancestor(X,Y
father(X,Y
ancestor(X,Z
father(X,Y
ancestor(Y,Z
This
can
be
read
as
for
every
X
and
Y
if
X
is
the
father
of
Y
and
Y
is
an
ancestor
of
Z
X
is
the
ancestor
of
Z
For
every
X
and
Y
X
is
the
ancestor
of
Z
if
X
is
the
father
of
Y
and
Y
is
an
ancestor
of
Z
Installing
Useful
Packages
For
starting
logic
programming
in
Python
we
need
to
install
the
following
two
packages
Kanren
It
provides
us
a
way
to
simplify
the
way
we
made
code
for
business
logic
It
lets
us
express
the
logic
in
terms
of
rules
and
facts
The
following
command
will
help
you
install
kanren
pip
install
kanren
SymPy
SymPy
is
a
Python
library
for
symbolic
mathematics
It
aims
to
become
a
full-featured
computer
algebra
system
CAS
while
keeping
the
code
as
simple
as
possible
in
order
to
be
comprehensible
and
easily
extensible
The
following
command
will
help
you
install
SymPy
pip
install
sympy
Examples
of
Logic
Programming
Followings
are
some
examples
which
can
be
solved
by
logic
programming
Matching
mathematical
expressions
Actually
we
can
find
the
unknown
values
by
using
logic
programming
in
a
very
effective
way
The
following
Python
code
will
help
you
match
a
mathematical
expression
Consider
importing
the
following
packages
first
from
kanren
import
run
var
fact
from
kanren.assoccomm
import
eq_assoccomm
as
eq
from
kanren.assoccomm
import
commutative
associative
We
need
to
define
the
mathematical
operations
which
we
are
going
to
use
add
add
mul
mul
Both
addition
and
multiplication
are
communicative
processes
Hence
we
need
to
specify
it
and
this
can
be
done
as
follows
fact(commutative
mul
fact(commutative
add
fact(associative
mul
fact(associative
add
It
is
compulsory
to
define
variables
this
can
be
done
as
follows
a
b
var
a
var
b
We
need
to
match
the
expression
with
the
original
pattern
We
have
the
following
original
pattern
which
is
basically
5
a
b
Original_pattern
mul
add
5
a
b
We
have
the
following
two
expressions
to
match
with
the
original
pattern
exp
1
mul
2
add
3
1
exp
2
add
5
mul
8
1
Output
can
be
printed
with
the
following
command
print(run
0
a,b
eq(original_pattern
exp
1
print(run
0
a,b
eq(original_pattern
exp
2
After
running
this
code
we
will
get
the
following
output
3
2
The
first
output
represents
the
values
for
a
and
b
The
first
expression
matched
the
original
pattern
and
returned
the
values
for
a
and
b
but
the
second
expression
did
not
match
the
original
pattern
hence
nothing
has
been
returned
Checking
for
Prime
Numbers
With
the
help
of
logic
programming
we
can
find
the
prime
numbers
from
a
list
of
numbers
and
can
also
generate
prime
numbers
The
Python
code
given
below
will
find
the
prime
number
from
a
list
of
numbers
and
will
also
generate
the
first
10
prime
numbers
Let
us
first
consider
importing
the
following
packages
from
kanren
import
isvar
run
membero
from
kanren.core
import
success
fail
goaleval
condeseq
eq
var
from
sympy.ntheory.generate
import
prime
isprime
import
itertools
as
it
Now
we
will
define
a
function
called
prime_check
which
will
check
the
prime
numbers
based
on
the
given
numbers
as
data
def
prime_check(x
if
isvar(x
return
condeseq
eq,x,p
for
p
in
map(prime
it.count
1
else
return
success
if
isprime(x
else
fail
Now
we
need
to
declare
a
variable
which
will
be
used
x
var
print
set(run
0
x
membero,x

Solving
Puzzles
Logic
programming
can
be
used
to
solve
many
problems
like
8
puzzles
Zebra
puzzle
Sudoku
N-queen
etc
Here
we
are
taking
an
example
of
a
variant
of
Zebra
puzzle
which
is
as
follows
There
are
five
houses
The
English
man
lives
in
the
red
house
The
Swede
has
a
dog
The
Dane
drinks
tea
The
green
house
is
immediately
to
the
left
of
the
white
house
They
drink
coffee
in
the
green
house
The
man
who
smokes
Pall
Mall
has
birds
In
the
yellow
house
they
smoke
Dunhill
In
the
middle
house
they
drink
milk
The
Norwegian
lives
in
the
first
house
The
man
who
smokes
Blend
lives
in
the
house
next
to
the
house
with
cats
In
a
house
next
to
the
house
where
they
have
a
horse
they
smoke
Dunhill
The
man
who
smokes
Blue
Master
drinks
beer
The
German
smokes
Prince
The
Norwegian
lives
next
to
the
blue
house
They
drink
water
in
a
house
next
to
the
house
where
they
smoke
Blend
We
are
solving
it
for
the
question
who
owns
zebra
with
the
help
of
Python
Let
us
import
the
necessary
packages
from
kanren
import
from
kanren.core
import
lall
import
time
Now
we
need
to
define
two
functions
left
and
next
to
check
whose
house
is
left
or
next
to
who’s
house
def
left(q
p
list
return
membero
q,p
zip(list
list
1
def
next(q
p
list
return
conde
left(q
p
list
left(p
q
list
Now
we
will
declare
a
variable
house
as
follows
houses
var
We
need
to
define
the
rules
with
the
help
of
lall
package
as
follows
There
are
5

Inductive
logic
programming
ILP
is
a
subfield
of
symbolic
artificial
intelligence
which
uses
logic
programming
as
a
uniform
representation
for
examples
background
knowledge
and
hypotheses
The
term
inductive
here
refers
to
philosophical
i.e
suggesting
a
theory
to
explain
observed
facts
rather
than
mathematical
i.e
proving
a
property
for
all
members
of
a
well-ordered
set
induction
Given
an
encoding
of
the
known
background
knowledge
and
a
set
of
examples
represented
as
a
logical
database
of
facts
an
ILP
system
will
derive
a
hypothesised
logic
program
which
entails
all
the
positive
and
none
of
the
negative
examples
Schema
positive
examples
negative
examples
background
knowledge

Inductive
logic
programming
is
particularly
useful
in
bioinformatics
and
natural
language
processing
History
edit
Building
on
earlier
work
on
Inductive
inference
Gordon
Plotkin
was
the
first
to
formalise
induction
in
a
clausal
setting
around
1970
adopting
an
approach
of
generalising
from
examples
1
2
In
1981
Ehud
Shapiro
introduced
several
ideas
that
would
shape
the
field
in
his
new
approach
of
model
inference
an
algorithm
employing
refinement
and
backtracing
to
search
for
a
complete
axiomatisation
of
given
examples
1
3
His
first
implementation
was
the
Model
Inference
System
in
1981
4
5
a
Prolog
program
that
inductively
inferred
Horn
clause
logic
programs
from
positive
and
negative
examples
1
The
term
Inductive
Logic
Programming
was
first
introduced
in
a
paper
by
Stephen
Muggleton
in
1990
defined
as
the
intersection
of
machine
learning
and
logic
programming
1
Muggleton
and
Wray
Buntine
introduced
predicate
invention
and
inverse
resolution
in
1988
1
6
Several
inductive
logic
programming
systems
that
proved
influential
appeared
in
the
early
1990
s
FOIL
introduced
by
Ross
Quinlan
in
1990
7
was
based
on
upgrading
propositional
learning
algorithms
AQ
and
ID

Golem
introduced
by
Muggleton
and
Feng
in
1990
went
back
to
a
restricted
form
of
Plotkin's
least
generalisation
algorithm
8
9
The
Progol
system
introduced
by
Muggleton
in
1995
first
implemented
inverse
entailment
and
inspired
many
later
systems
8
10
11
Aleph
a
descendant
of
Progol
introduced
by
Ashwin
Srinivasan
in
2001
is
still
one
of
the
most
widely
used
systems
as
of
2022
update
10
At
around
the
same
time
the
first
practical
applications
emerged
particularly
in
bioinformatics
where
by
2000
inductive
logic
programming
had
been
successfully
applied
to
drug
design
carcinogenicity
and
mutagenicity
prediction
and
elucidation
of
the
structure
and
function
of
proteins
12
Unlike
the
focus
on
automatic
programming
inherent
in
the
early
work
these
fields
used
inductive
logic
programming
techniques
from
a
viewpoint
of
relational
data
mining
The
success
of
those
initial
applications
and
the
lack
of
progress
in
recovering
larger
traditional
logic
programs
shaped
the
focus
of
the
field
13
Recently
classical
tasks
from
automated
programming
have
moved
back
into
focus
as
the
introduction
of
meta-interpretative
learning
makes
predicate
invention
and
learning
recursive
programs
more
feasible
This
technique
was
pioneered
with
the
Metagol
system
introduced
by
Muggleton
Dianhuan
Lin
Niels
Pahlavi
and
Alireza
Tamaddoni-Nezhad
in
2014
14
This
allows
ILP
systems
to
work
with
fewer
examples
and
brought
successes
in
learning
string
transformation
programs
answer
set
grammars
and
general
algorithms
15
Setting
edit
Inductive
logic
programming
has
adopted
several
different
learning
settings
the
most
common
of
which
are
learning
from
entailment
and
learning
from
interpretations
16
In
both
cases
the
input
is
provided
in
the
form
of
background
knowledge
B
a
logical
theory
commonly
in
the
form
of
clauses
used
in
logic
programming
as
well
as
positive
and
negative
examples

partial
Herbrand
structures
each
of

themselves
a

Then
the

is
obtained
as
the

of
the

of

which

To
account
for
background
knowledge
inductive
logic
programming
systems
employ
relative
least
general
generalisations
which
are
defined
in
terms
of
subsumption
relative
to
a
background
theory
In
general
such
relative
least
general
generalisations
are
not
guaranteed
to
exist
however
if
the
background
theory
B
is
a
finite
set
of
ground
literals
then
the
negation
of
B
is
itself
a
clause
In
this
case
a
relative
least
general
generalisation
can
be
computed
by
disjoining
the
negation
of
B
with
both

Inverse
resolution
edit
Inverse
resolution
is
an
inductive
reasoning
technique
that
involves
inverting
the
resolution
operator
Inverse
resolution
takes
information
about
the
resolvent
of
a
resolution
step
to
compute
possible
resolving
clauses
Two
types
of
inverse
resolution
operator
are
in
use
in
inductive
logic
programming
V-operators
and
W-operators
A

Inverse
resolution
was
first
introduced
by
Stephen
Muggleton
and
Wray
Buntine
in
1988
for
use
in
the
inductive
logic
programming
system
Cigol
6
By
1993
this
spawned
a
surge
of
research
into
inverse
resolution
operators
and
their
properties

they
generalize
the
negation
of
the
bridge
theory
F
with
anti-entailment
26
However
the
operation
of
anti-entailment
is
computationally
more
expensive
since
it
is
highly
nondeterministic
Therefore
an
alternative
hypothesis
search
can
be
conducted
using
the
inverse
subsumption
anti-subsumption
operation
instead
which
is
less
non-deterministic
than
anti-entailment
Questions
of
completeness
of
a
hypothesis
search
procedure
of
specific
inductive
logic
programming
system
arise
For
example
the
Progol
hypothesis
search
procedure
based
on
the
inverse
entailment
inference
rule
is
not
complete
by
Yamamoto's
example
27
On
the
other
hand
Imparo
is
complete
by
both
anti-entailment
procedure
28
and
its
extended
inverse
subsumption
29
procedure
Metainterpretive
learning
edit
Rather
than
explicitly
searching
the
hypothesis
graph
metainterpretive
or
meta-level
systems
encode
the
inductive
logic
programming
program
as
a
meta-level
logic
program
which
is
then
solved
to
obtain
an
optimal
hypothesis
Formalisms
used
to
express
the
problem
specification
include
Prolog
and
answer
set
programming
with
existing
Prolog
systems
and
answer
set
solvers
used
for
solving
the
constraints
30
And
example
of
a
Prolog-based
system
is
Metagol
which
is
based
on
a
meta-interpreter
in
Prolog
while
ASPAL
and
ILASP
are
based
on
an
encoding
of
the
inductive
logic
programming
problem
in
answer
set
programming
30
Evolutionary
learning
edit
Evolutionary
algorithms
in
ILP
use
a
population-based
approach
to
evolve
hypotheses
refining
them
through
selection
crossover
and
mutation
Methods
like
EvoLearner
have
been
shown
to
outperform
traditional
approaches
on
structured
machine
learning
benchmarks

examples
is
minimized
35
This
problem
has
two
variants
parameter
learning
and
structure
learning
In
the
former
one
is
given
the
structure
the
clauses
of
H
and
the
goal
is
to
infer
the
probabilities
annotations
of
the
given
clauses
while
in
the
latter
the
goal
is
to
infer
both
the
structure
and
the
probability
parameters
of
H
Just
as
in
classical
inductive
logic
programming
the
examples
can
be
given
as
examples
or
as
partial
interpretations
35
Parameter
Learning
edit
Parameter
learning
for
languages
following
the
distribution
semantics
has
been
performed
by
using
an
expectation-maximisation
algorithm
or
by
gradient
descent
An
expectation-maximisation
algorithm
consists
of
a
cycle
in
which
the
steps
of
expectation
and
maximization
are
repeatedly
performed
In
the
expectation
step
the
distribution
of
the
hidden
variables
is
computed
according
to
the
current
values
of
the
probability
parameters
while
in
the
maximisation
step
the
new
values
of
the
parameters
are
computed
Gradient
descent
methods
compute
the
gradient
of
the
target
function
and
iteratively
modify
the
parameters
moving
in
the
direction
of
the
gradient
35
Structure
Learning
edit
Structure
learning
was
pioneered
by
Daphne
Koller
and
Avi
Pfeffer
in
1997
36
where
the
authors
learn
the
structure
of
first-order
rules
with
associated
probabilistic
uncertainty
parameters
Their
approach
involves
generating
the
underlying
graphical
model
in
a
preliminary
step
and
then
applying
expectation-maximisation
35
In
2008
De
Raedt
et
al
presented
an
algorithm
for
performing
theory
compression
on
ProbLog
programs
where
theory
compression
refers
to
a
process
of
removing
as
many
clauses
as
possible
from
the
theory
in
order
to
maximize
the
probability
of
a
given
set
of
positive
and
negative
examples
No
new
clause
can
be
added
to
the
theory
35
37
In
the
same
year
Meert
W
et
al
introduced
a
method
for
learning
parameters
and
structure
of
ground
probabilistic
logic
programs
by
considering
the
Bayesian
networks
equivalent
to
them
and
applying
techniques
for
learning
Bayesian
networks
38
35
ProbFOIL
introduced
by
De
Raedt
and
Ingo
Thon
in
2010
combined
the
inductive
logic
programming
system
FOIL
with
ProbLog
Logical
rules
are
learned
from
probabilistic
data
in
the
sense
that
both
the
examples
themselves
and
their
classifications
can
be
probabilistic
The
set
of
rules
has
to
allow
one
to
predict
the
probability
of
the
examples
from
their
description
In
this
setting
the
parameters
the
probability
values
are
fixed
and
the
structure
has
to
be
learned
39
35
In
2011
Elena
Bellodi
and
Fabrizio
Riguzzi
introduced
SLIPCASE
which
performs
a
beam
search
among
probabilistic
logic
programs
by
iteratively
refining
probabilistic
theories
and
optimizing
the
parameters
of
each
theory
using
expectation-maximisation
40
Its
extension
SLIPCOVER
proposed
in
2014
uses
bottom
clauses
generated
as
in
Progol
to
guide
the
refinement
process
thus
reducing
the
number
of
revisions
and
exploring
the
search
space
more
effectively
Moreover
SLIPCOVER
separates
the
search
for
promising
clauses
from
that
of
the
theory
the
space
of
clauses
is
explored
with
a
beam
search
while
the
space
of
theories
is
searched
greedily

In
a
previous
post
we
have
seen
how
datalog
language
and
consequently
logic
programming
can
be
convenient
in
the
context
of
data
querying
and
exploration
We
will
now
see
how
logic
programming
can
be
helpful
in
the
context
of
data
transformation
Let's
first
have
a
deeper
look
at
logic
programming
concepts
What-is
Logic
Programming
Logic
programming
is
a
programming
paradigm
that
is
based
on
formal
logic
In
logic
programming
programs
are
written
in
the
form
of
logical
statements
or
rules
which
define
relationships
and
constraints
between
different
entities
alt
text
Unlike
other
programming
paradigms
such
as
functional
programming
and
object-oriented
programming
which
focus
on
how
to
achieve
a
specific
task
logic
programming
is
concerned
with
representing
and
reasoning
about
knowledge
Programs
written
in
a
logic
programming
language
mainly
consist
of
a
set
of
facts
rules
and
queries
Facts
describe
the
problem
data
while
rules
describe
the
relationships
between
the
data
Queries
are
statements
or
questions
posed
to
the
system
that
express
a
goal
or
a
condition
that
needs
to
be
satisfied
Facts
John
is
a
parent
of
Jim
John
is
a
parent
of
Ann
Mary
is
a
parent
of
Jim
Mary
is
a
parent
of
Ann
John
is
a
male
Mary
is
a
female
Rules
A
person
is
a
father
if
they
are
a
parent
and
male
A
person
is
a
mother
if
they
are
a
parent
and
female
Two
individuals
are
siblings
if
they
share
the
same
parent
Queries
Is
John
the
father
of
Jim
yes
Are
Jim
and
Ann
siblings
yes
Is
Mary
the
mother
of
Jim
yes
Logic
programming
is
particularly
suited
to
problems
that
can
be
represented
as
logical
relationships
For
example
logic
programming
can
be
used
to
solve
inference
reasoning
and
planning
problems
This
makes
it
well-suited
for
applications
that
require
a
deep
understanding
of
complex
domains
such
as
natural
language
processing
or
expert
systems
Building
Blocks
Here
are
the
key
features
of
the
logic
programming
paradigm
Declarative
Style
Logic
programming
is
declarative
meaning
that
you
specify
what
you
want
to
achieve
rather
than
how
to
achieve
it
Logic
Rules
Programs
consist
of
a
set
of
logical
rules
or
clauses
These
rules
are
expressed
in
the
form
of
predicates
and
facts
which
represent
relationships
between
objects
or
conditions
Pattern
Matching
The
evaluation
of
logical
statements
often
involves
pattern
matching
The
system
matches
the
input
against
the
logical
rules
to
determine
if
they
apply
Knowledge
Representation
Uses
a
formal
language
that
is
precise
and
unambiguous
This
allows
for
clear
and
concise
descriptions
of
complex
relationships
and
concepts
Reasoning
and
Inference
The
interpreter
can
use
the
knowledge
base
to
draw
conclusions
solve
problems
and
answer
queries
This
makes
it
valuable
for
applications
that
require
a
deep
understanding
of
data
and
the
ability
to
make
logical
deductions
Backtracking
Logic
programming
often
involves
a
mechanism
called
backtracking
If
a
particular
path
of
inference
does
not
lead
to
a
solution
the
system
can
backtrack
and
explore
alternative
paths
Application
Domains
Here
are
some
generic
examples
of
how
logic
programming
can
be
used
To
represent
knowledge
about
the
real
world
such
as
relationships
between
objects
or
properties
of
objects
To
reason
about
this
knowledge
for
example
to
find
solutions
to
problems
or
to
draw
conclusions
To
generate
code
for
example
to
translate
logical
rules
into
programming
instructions

Here
are
some
specific
domains
of
application
Artificial
Intelligence
Logic
programming
is
a
fundamental
building
block
of
artificial
intelligence
AI
techniques
It's
used
in
various
AI
applications
including
symbolic
reasoning
machine
learning
and
knowledge
engineering
Natural
Language
Processing
Logic
programming
is
used
in
natural
language
processing
NLP
applications
to
analyze
and
understand
human
language
It
helps
in
tasks
like
machine
translation
text
summarization
and
question
answering
Expert
Systems
Logic
programming
plays
a
crucial
role
in
building
expert
systems
which
are
computer
programs
that
emulate
human
expertise
in
a
specific
domain
It
helps
in
representing
domain
knowledge
reasoning
about
complex
problems
and
providing
expert
advice
Database
Management
Systems
Logic
programming
is
integrated
into
some
database
management
systems
DBMS
to
provide
advanced
query
capabilities
and
knowledge-based
features
It
helps
in
handling
complex
queries
managing
meta-data
and
performing
data
mining
tasks
Verification
and
Validation
Logic
programming
is
used
in
verification
and
validation
of
data
consistency
to
ensure
its
correctness
and
adherence
to
specifications
It
helps
in
formalizing
requirements
and
identifying
potential
errors
When
to
use
logic
programming
Logic
programming
has
several
advantages
that
it
may
be
advisable
to
exploit
in
certain
situations
Being
declarative
means
that
logic
programs
focus
on
what
the
program
should
do
rather
than
how
it
should
do
it
making
them
easier
to
understand
maintain
and
modify
Furthermore
logic
programs
are
expressive
allowing
them
to
represent
complex
and
abstract
concepts
in
a
concise
and
natural
way
Additionally
logic
programs
are
flexible
and
can
accommodate
different
modes
of
execution
such
as
forward
chaining
or
backward
chaining
which
are
especially
useful
in
rules-engines

Data-driven
architecture
The
Data-Driven
approach
provides
several
benefits
that
contribute
to
the
flexibility
adaptability
and
efficiency
of
a
system
However
it
often
poses
problems
of
efficiency
in
terms
of
developments
as
structures
become
more
complex
and
the
diversity
of
models
increases
Working
with
complex
data
structures
is
like
navigating
a
dense
jungle
the
built-in
tools
are
your
machete
but
youll
often
need
a
bit
of
hacking
and
slashing
to
find
your
way
through
Logic
programming
can
significantly
enhance
data-driven
architectures
by
providing
a
declarative
and
knowledge-driven
approach
to
data
processing
and
analysis
Its
ability
to
represent
complex
relationships
and
perform
logical
reasoning
can
help
extracting
meaningful
information
from
vast
amounts
of
data
rsz_logic_model_resized.jpg
Logic
programming
offers
a
powerful
and
versatile
approach
that
makes
it
a
valuable
tool
for
extracting
information
from
data
and
enabling
knowledge-driven
decision-making
Synergy
with
functional
programming
We
have
seen
logic
programming
offers
a
powerful
approach
for
tasks
that
require
extensive
knowledge
representation
reasoning
and
inference
On
its
end
the
functional
programming
emphasizes
the
concept
of
pure
functions
which
are
functions
that
take
input
values
and
produce
output
values
without
any
side
effects
This
means
that
a
function's
output
depends
solely
on
its
input
and
it
does
not
modify
any
external
state
or
data
Immutability
Data
is
treated
as
immutable
meaning
it
cannot
be
changed
once
created
This
ensures
data
integrity
and
simplifies
reasoning
about
program
behavior
Expression-oriented
Programs
are
composed
of
expressions
that
evaluate
to
values
rather
than
statements
that
modify
state
This
emphasizes
the
declarative
nature
of
functional
programming
Higher-order
functions
Functions
can
take
other
functions
as
arguments
or
return
functions
as
results
This
allows
for
powerful
abstractions
and
concise
code
Functional
programming
and
logic
programming
are
both
declarative
programming
paradigms
that
offer
unique
strengths
and
applications

Taking
the
best
of
both
worlds
While
functional
programming
and
logic
programming
are
two
distinct
programming
paradigms
there
are
areas
of
overlap
and
potential
synergies
between
them
Declarative
Style
Functional
Programming
emphasizes
a
declarative
style
where
programs
are
written
as
a
series
of
mathematical-like
expressions
Logic
Programming
also
follows
a
declarative
style
where
programs
describe
relationships
and
constraints
rather
than
a
sequence
of
steps
Expressiveness
Leveraging
the
expressiveness
of
both
paradigms
can
lead
to
more
concise
and
expressive
programs
especially
in
domains
involving
complex
relationships
and
constraints
Despite
the
fact
functional
and
logic
programming
have
distinct
design
principles
their
combination
or
integration
can
lead
to
powerful
and
expressive
programming
models
Therefore
librairies
and
frameworks
of
functional
languages
that
incorporate
features
from
logic
paradigm
pattern-matching
logic-rules
such
as
datascript
which
is
based
on
datalog
and
prolog
principles
continue
to
be
developed
and
may
be
very
good
options
to
consider
A

look

now
dive
into
implementations
in
the
clojure
ecosystem

programming
into

global

based
on
versatile
and
commonly
used
programming
languages
A
Real-Life
scenario
Let's
now
address
the
question
of
using
logic
programming
concepts
in
a
concrete
use-case
In
a
previous
article
I
discussed
the
fact
I
developed
a
software
whose
main
purpose
is
to
transform
complex
data
The
Clojure
language
allowed
me
to
respond
to
the
overall
complexity
of
the
solution
However
as
the
complexity
of
the
software
increased
I
increasingly
felt
the
need
to
represent
all
the
rules
for
managing
transformations
several
hundred
to
date
as
well
as
business
rules
for
data
validation
with
a
desire
to
express
these
in
an
understandable
and
maintainable
format
Until
then
I
used
transformation
functions
that
include
if-conditionals
to
apply
changes
only
on
certains
conditions
such
as
matching
ids
as
follows
defn
assemble
a
b
if
and
id
a
id
b
weight
b
weight
a
predicates
update
a
weight
weight
b
transformation
a
else
assemble
id
123
weight
100
id
123
weight
25
id
123
weight
125
assemble
id
123
weight
100
id
456
weight
25
id
123
weight
100
The
approach
based
on
the
Meander
library
allows
to
pass
all
the
business
logic
in
more
a
declarative
form
for
all
the
rules
for
pattern-matching
and
transformation
require
meander.epsilon
as
m
defn
assemble
a
b
m/match
a
a
b
b
facts
a
id
id

weight-a
b

weight
125
assemble
id
123
weight
100
id
456
weight
25
id
123
weight
100
In
addition
the
expressive
approach
of
meander
makes
it
possible
to
extract
the
definiton
of
the
rule
in
the
form
of
a
data
structure
which
once
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
code
represents
a
kind
of
predicate-as-data
for
declaring
all
the
business
logic
of
the
solution
Let's
go
a
step
further
and
try
see
how
to
use
a
domain-specific
language
DSL
to
express
rules
for
the
same
operations
require
meander.epsilon
as
m

In
summary
today
I
take
advantage
of
the
joint
use
of
the
native
functionalities
of
Clojure
and
some
features
taken
from
the
logical
programming
paradigm
The
best
of
both
worlds
Caveats
Conclusion
While
logic
programming
offers
a
unique
and
powerful
approach
to
problem-solving
it
is
not
without
its
limitations
and
challenges
Here
are
some
of
the
caveats
of
logic
programming
that
should
be
considered
when
evaluating
its
suitability
for
a
specific
project
Computational
Efficiency
Logic
programming
can
be
computationally
expensive
especially
for
complex
problems
with
large
knowledge
bases
The
search
for
solutions
through
logical
inference
can
become
time-consuming
particularly
in
cases
where
multiple
solutions
exist
or
when
dealing
with
extensive
data
sets
Non-determinism
Logic
programming
is
an
inherently
non-deterministic
programming
paradigm
meaning
that
the
system
is
designed
to
find
all
possible
solutions
rather
than
a
single
deterministic
result
This
non-determinism
can
be
difficult
to
control
and
may
lead
to
unpredictable
behavior
especially
in
large-scale
applications
Debugging
Complexity
Debugging
logic
programs
can
be
challenging
due
to
their
declarative
nature
and
the
non-deterministic
execution
flow
Identifying
the
source
of
errors
or
unexpected
results
can
be
time-consuming
and
may
require
a
deep
understanding
of
the
underlying
logic
and
search
strategies

Despite
these
caveats
logic
programming
remains
a
valuable
tool
for
a
variety
of
applications
particularly
those
that
require
knowledge
representation
Careful
consideration
of
these
limitations
and
understanding
the
strengths
of
logic
programming
are
crucial
for
making
informed
decisions
about
its
suitability
for
specific
projects
Logic
programming
is
not
a
silver
bullet
But
it
offers
a
range
of
very
interesting
possibilities
if
used
sparingly
To
date
the
timely
use
of
functionalities
taken
from
logic
programming
has
made
it
possible
to
considerably
improve
the
maintainability
of
my
code
in
production
I
will
therefore
continue
to
rely
on
this
approach
for
future
developments

The
Resource
Description
Framework
RDF
Model&Syntax
Specification
describes
a
metadata
infrastructure
which
can
accommodate
classification
elements
from
different
vocabularies
i.e
schemas
The
underlying
model
consists
of
a
labeled
directed
acyclic
graph
which
can
be
linearized
into
eXtensible
Markup
Language
XML
transfer
syntax
for
interchange
between
applications
This
paper
will
demonstrate
how
a
new
querying
language
Metalog
allows
users
to
write
inference
rules
and
queries
in
English-like
syntax
We
will
demonstrate
how
these
reasoning
rules
have
equivalent
representation
both
as
RDF
descriptions
and
as
logic
programs
We
will
also
show
how
an
automated
compilation
between
these
translations
is
possible
For
the
sake
of
clarity
here
we
will
just
give
an
overview
of
the
system
trying
to
avoid
technicalities
and
cumbersome
details
Query
Languages
In
general
query
languages
are
formal
languages
to
retrieve
data
from
a
database
Standardadized
languages
already
exist
to
retrieve
information
from
different
types
of
databases
such
as
Structured
Query
Language
SQL
for
relational
databases
and
Object
Query
Language
OQL
and
SQL
3
for
object
relational
databases
Semi-structured
query
languages
such
as
XML-QL
3
operate
on
a
document
level
structure
taking
advantage
of
the
internal
element
structure
of
an
XML
document
Logic
programs
consist
of
facts
and
rules
where
valid
inference
rules
are
used
to
arrives
into
new
facts
i.e
query
results
With
RDF
the
most
suitable
approach
is
to
focus
on
the
underlying
data
model
Even
though
XML-QL
could
be
used
to
query
RDF
descriptions
in
their
XML
encoded
form
a
single
RDF
data
model
could
not
be
correctly
determined
with
a
single
XML-QL
query
due
to
the
fact
that
RDF
allows
several
XML
syntax
encodings
for
the
same
data
model
The
Metalog
Approach
RDF
provides
the
basis
for
structuring
the
data
present
on
the
Web
in
a
consistent
and
accurate
way
However
RDF
is
only
the
first
step
towards
the
construction
of
what
Tim
Berners-Lee
calls
the
Web
of
knowledge
a
World
Wide
Web
where
data
is
structured
and
users
can
fully
benefit
by
this
structure
when
accessing
information
on
the
Web
RDF
only
provides
the
basic
vocabulary
in
which
data
can
be
expressed
and
structured
Then
the
whole
problem
of
accessing
an
managing
these
data
structures
arises
Metalog
provides
a
logical
view
of
metadata
present
on
the
Web
The
Metalog
approach
is
composed
of
several
components
In
the
first
component
a
particular
data
semantics
is
established
Metalog
provides
way
to
express
logical
relationships
such
as
and
or
and
to
build
up
complex
inference
rules
that
encode
logical
reasoning
This
semantic
layer
builds
on
top
of
RDF
using
a
so-called
RDF
schema
The
second
component
consists
of
a
logical
interpretation
of
RDF
data
optionally
enriched
with
the
semantic
schema
into
logic
programming
This
way
the
understood
semantics
of
RDF
is
unwielded
into
its
logical
components
a
logic
program
indeed
This
means
that
every
reasonment
on
RDF
data
can
be
performed
acting
upon
the
corresponding
logical
view
the
logic
program
providing
a
neat
and
powerful
way
to
reason
about
data
The
third
component
is
a
language
interface
to
writing
structured
data
and
reasoning
rules
In
principle
the
first
component
already
suffices
data
and
rules
can
be
written
directly
in
RDF
using
RDF
syntax
and
the
Metalog
schema
However
this
is
not
convenient
from
the
practical
viewpoint
Indeed
RDF
syntax
aims
at
being
more
an
encoding
language
rather
than
a
user-friendly
language
and
it
is
well
recognised
in
the
RDF
community
and
among
vendors
that
the
typical
applications
will
provide
more
user-friendly
interfaces
between
the
raw
RDF
code
and
the
user
Our
proposed
language
is
innovative
in
that
it
tries
to
stress
user-friendliness
as
much
as
possible
a
program
is
a
collection
of
natural
language
assertions
We
think
this
feature
will
be
particularly
important
for
the
wide
deployment
not
only
of
metalog
but
of
RDF
itself
the
measure
of
the
success
of
metadata
and
proper
structuring
of
information
on
the
Web
is
given
by
the
number
of
people
that
will
actually
lose
time
and
energy
in
write
and/or
translate
data
into
the
structured
format
Therefore
it
is
of
primary
importance
that
the
entry
level
is
kept
extremely
easy
to
avoid
that
the
difficuly
of
just
learning
how
to
encode
and
structure
data
will
just
block
the
widespread
diffusion
of
metadata
on
the
Web
Another
important
feature
of
the
language
in
this
respect
is
indeed
that
it
can
be
used
just
as
an
interface
to
RDF
without
the
metalog
extensions
This
way
users
will
be
able
to
access
and
structure
metadata
using
RDF
in
a
smooth
and
seamless
way
using
the
metalog
language
The
Metalog
Schema
The
first
correspondance
in
Metalog
is
between
the
basic
RDF
data
model
and
the
predicates
in
logic
The
RDF
data
model
consists
of
so-called
statements
Statements
are
triples
where
there
is
a
subject
the
resource
a
predicate
the
property
and
an
object
the
literal
Metalog
views
an
RDF
statement
in
the
logical
setting
as
just
a
binary
predicate
involving
the
subject
and
the
literal
For
example
the
RDF
statement
expressing
the
fact
that
Tim
Berners-Lee
invented
the
Web
formally
the
RDF
triple
invented
Tim
Berners-Lee
Web
is
seen
in
logic
programming
as
the
predicate
invented(Tim
Berners-Lee
Web
Once
we
have
estalished
the
basic
correspondance
between
the
basic
RDF
data
model
and
predicates
in
logic
the
next
step
becomes
easy
we
can
extend
RDF
so
that
the
mapping
to
logic
is
able
to
take
advantage
of
all
of
the
logical
relationships
present
in
logical
systems
that
is
to
say
beyond
the
ability
of
expressing
static
facts
we
want
the
ability
to
encode
dynamic
reasoning
rules
like
in
logic
programming
In
order
to
do
so
we
need
at
least
the
standard
logical
connectors
and
or
not
variables
The
Metalog
schema
extends
plain
RDF
with
this
logical
layer
enabling
the
expression
of
arbitrary
logical
relationships
within
RDF
In
fact
the
Metalog
schema
provides
more
accessories
besides
the
aforementioned
basic
ones
Without
elaborating
here
all
the
Metalog
schema
elements
since
they
will
be
presented
later
what
the
reader
should
keep
in
mind
is
just
that
the
Metalog
schema
provides
the
meta-logic
operators
to
reason
with
RDF
statements
Technically
this
is
quite
easy
to
do
the
metalog
schema
is
just
a
schema
as
defined
by
the
RDF
schema
specification
Brickley
99
where
for
example
and
and
or
are
sub-instances
of
the
RDF
Bag
connector
The
mapping
between
metalog
RDF
and
logical
formulas
is
then
completely
natural
for
each
RDF
statement
that
does
not
use
a
Metalog
connector
there
is
a
corresponding
logical
predicate
as
defined
before
Then
the
metalog
connectors
are
translated
into
the
corresponding
logical
connectors
in
the
natural
way
so
for
instance
the
metalog
and
connector
is
mapped
using
logical
conjunction
while
the
metalog
or
connector
is
mapped
using
logical
disjunction
The
Metalog
Syntax
Note
that
the
RDF
metalog
schema
and
the
corresponding
translation
into
logical
formulas
is
absolutely
general
However
in
practicse
one
need
also
to
then
be
able
to
process
the
resulting
logical
formulas
in
an
effective
ways
In
other
words
while
the
RDF
metalog
schema
nicely
extends
RDF
with
the
full
power
of
first
order
predicate
calculus
thus
increasing
by
far
the
expressibility
of
basic
RDF
there
is
still
the
other
computational
side
of
the
coin
how
to
process
and
effectively
reason
with
all
these
logical
inference
rules
It
is
well
known
that
in
general
dealing
with
full
first
order
predicate
calculus
is
totally
unfeasable
computationally
So
what
we
would
like
to
have
is
a
subset
of
predicate
calculus
that
is
still
expressible
enough
and
also
computationally
feasible
our
choice
went
to
logic
programming
Logic
programming
see
e.g
1
is
a
well
known
programming
paradigm
that
selects
a
subset
of
full
first-order
predicate
calculus
so
called
Horn
clauses
it
is
a
very
powerful
and
expressive
paradigm
and
has
the
further
advantage
that
it
has
been
widely
studied
in
the
database
community
a
subset
of
logic
programming
datalog
has
even
the
advantage
of
having
computations
always
terminating
a
feature
of
obvious
interest
for
Web
queries
The
third
level
is
then
the
actual
syntax
interface
between
the
user
and
this
metalog
RDF
encoding
with
the
constraint
that
the
expressibility
of
the
language
must
fit
within
the
one
provided
by
logic
programming
The
metalog
syntax
has
been
explicitly
designed
with
the
purpose
of
being
totally
natural-language
based
trying
to
avoid
any
possible
technicalities
and
therefore
making
the
language
extrememly
readable
and
self-descriptive
The
way
metalog
reaches
this
scope
is
by
a
careful
use
of
upper/lower
case
quotes
and
by
allowing
a
rather
liberal
positioning
of
the
keywords
an
advanced
parser
then
disambiguates
the
keywords
from
each
metalog
program
line
Metalog
grammar
The
tokens
in
the
Metalog
language
can
be
rougly
divided
into
four
categories
1
variables
2
literals
3
keywords
4
noise
words
In
the
following
subsections
we
present
how
these
tokens
are
recognized
There
is
also
an
example
following
each
of
these
subsections
to
demonstrate
how
the
recognization
works
in
practice
Variables
Upper/lower
case
is
used
to
distingush
between
normal
keywords
and
variables
variables
are
expressed
using
names
all
in
upper
case
for
example
FOO
is
a
variable
Words
that
are
in
lower
case
either
are
keywords
reserved
words
or
if
not
they
are
ignored
For
example
then
is
a
keyword
while
foo
is
not
and
so
it
is
just
ignored
it
is
only
syntactic
sugaring
Other
words
can
be
either
keywords
or
they
are
just
ignored
In
the
current
version
of
metalog
words
cannot
intermingle
upper
and
lower
case
this
helps
to
reduce
errors
and
to
improve
readability
since
it
strengthens
the
layout
difference
between
variables
and
the
other
words

Literals

name
which
is

Keywords
The
following
set
of
keywords
are
reserved
in
metalog
Interpretation
of
the
keywords
is
done
in
metalog
on
a
positional
basis
the
position
of
the
keyword
with
respect
to
other
keywords
and/or
other
data
determines
the
interpretation
of
the
sentence
The
reserved
keywords
are
then
is
a
keyword
for
the
logical
implication
For
example
if
SHE
has
a
degree
in
math
then
SHE
is
smart
is
translated
into
the
logical
formula
degree(SHE
math
is(SHE
smart
Note
that
here
and
in
the
following
examples
we
provide
directly
the
translation
into
the
logical
formula
to
save
space
a
more
detailed
translation
would
have
to
also
show
the
intermediate
RDF
model
which
is
in
any
case
trivial
to
derive
imply
is
a
keyword
for
the
logical
implication
implies
is
a
keyword
for
the
logical
implication
and
can
be
either
the
metalog
and
or
it
can
be
used
to
indicate
the
presence
of
an
RDF
Bag
this
is
disambiguated
by
the
context
For
example
if
SHE
has
a
degree
in
math
and
SHE
has
a
degree
in
computer
science
as
well
then
SHE
is
really
smart
is
translated
into
the
logical
formula
degree(SHE
math
and
degree(SHE
computer
science
is(SHE
really
smart
On
the
other
hand
as
said
and
can
be
used
to
denote
an
RDF
Bag
a
set
the
technical
report
231
has
as
authors
Mary
and
John
is
translated
into
the
logical
formulas
the
translation
here
is
more
involved
since
the
RDF
Bag
construct
is
used
authors

report
231

John
or

be
either

or
or
it

RDF
Alt
an
alternatives
list
this
is
disambiguated
by
the
context
order
the
presence
of
this
keyword
turns
an
RDF
Bag
into
an
RDF
Seq
an
ordered
list
For
example
the
technical
report
231
has
as
authors
Mary
and
John
in
this
order
is
translated
into
the
logical
formulas
the

Mary

foo
John
not
can
be
combined
with
any
other
metalog
constructs
and
its
interpretation
is
logical
negation
For
example
if
SHE
has
a
degree
in
math
then
SHE
is
not
stupid
is
translated
into
the
logical
formula
degree(SHE
math
not(is(SHE
stupid
The
dot
is
the
separator
between
metalog
program
lines
For
formatting
purposes
carriage
returns
line
feeds
can
tabs
can
be
used
they
are
simply
ignored
Similarly
commas
and
semicolon
can
be
used
as
well
A
trailing
question
mark
is
used
to
denote
a
query
Note
metalog
programs
also
have
a
facility
to
express
namespaces
via
the
keyword
namespace
We
will
not
go
in
further
details
since
we
won't
be
explicitly
using
namespaces
sugaring
here
but
en
passant
we
just
mention
that
essentially
the
namespace
keyword
has
the
same
functionality
as
the
xmlns
attribute
for
XML
namespaces
Also
there
are
a
number
of
other
keywords
that
deal
for
example
with
numbers
operations
e.g
greater
less
etc
but
for
the
sake
of
brevity
we
don't
go
in
their
rather
obvious

Completeness
requirements
Designing
a
new
query
language
for
RDF
data
model
requires
inherently
that
the
language
covers
all
RDF
constructs
These
constructs
are
statements
containers

seq
higher-order
statements
Conflicts
with
Natural
Language
The
main
issue
when
dealing
with
a
syntax
based
on
natural
English
language
is
how
to
determine
predicate
subject
and
object
always
correctly
i.e
the
building
blocks
of
RDF
statements

People

adopt
only
one

i.e

If
the
predicate
is
a

it
is
not
possible
to
translate
this

Reserved

Metalog
reserves
the
use
of
the

and

of
Roles
of
Metalog
Metalog
can
be
used
into
three
different
purposes
authoring
and
understanding
facts
rules
and
queries
We
will
elaborate
their
definition
and
expression
in
Metalog
in
the
following
subsections
Facts
in
Metalog
Facts
are
recognized
by
the
lack
of
existance
of
both
if
and
what
keywords
withn
a
Metalog
sentence
In
this
case
the
first
token
will
be
a
variable
or
a
literal

in

Containers
in
RDF
Metalog
supports
the
container
structures
of
RDF
i.e
bags
alternatives
and
sequences
The
following
subsections
elaborate
how
these
structures
differ
from
each
other
and
how
they
are
encoded
in
Metalog
Bags
Bags
do
not
preserve
of
implicate
order
Thus
it
is
safe
to
say
multiple
values
within
a
statement
i.e
The
author
of
http
www.w
3
org/RDF/Metalog
are
Massimo
Marchiori
and
Janne
Saarela
literal
keyword(of
literal
keyword(are
literal
keyword(and
literal
Alternatives
Alternatives
imply
that
only
one
member
of
a
Alternative
container
is
valid
at
a
time
This
sets
requirements
for
authoring
and
querying
In
authoring
the
Metalog
statement
must
imply
the
values
of
the
statement
are
mutually
exclusive
with
the
reserved
keyword
combination

one
of
In
querying
Let
us
examine
the
tokenization
of
Metalog
sentences
using
Alternatives
The
author
of

is
one
of
Massimo
Marchiori
and
Janne
Saarela
literal
keyword(of
literal
keyword(is
one
of

Sequences
Sequences
do
preserve
order
in
RDF
which
sets
requirements
for
authoring
and
querying
In
authoring
the
Metalog
statement
must
imply
the
values
of
the
statement
have
order
with
the
order
reserved
keyword
In
querying
additional
constraints
can
be
set
to
a
query
i.e
whether
2
or
3
value
matches
or
multiple
values
match
in
given
order
Let
us
examine
the
tokenization
of
couple

Sequence

A
detailed
example
Suppose
we
want
to
encode
the
rule
that
if
a
person
has
written
a
document
in
some
language
for
example
English
then
he
can
speak
in
that
language
The
corresponding
metalog
program
would
be
if
the
language
of
a
DOCUMENT
is
Y
and
the
author
of
the
DOCUMENT
is
X
then
X
can
speak
Y
This
can
be
translated
into
the
following
piece
of
RDF
syntax
Procedure
Head
Conjunction
Predicate
name
speak
rdf:Seq
rdf:li
Variable
X
Variable

Body
Procedure
And
finally
this
corresponds
to
the
logical
formula
speak(X,Y
author(DOCUMENT,X
and
language(DOCUMENT,Y
So
suppose
we
have
already
grabbed
from
somewhere
on
the
Web
some
pieces
of
RDF
that
tell
us
for
example
that
John
is
the
author
of
technical
report
231
and
that
the
language
of
technical
report
231
is
English
Then
if
we
want
to
know
what
language
does
John
speak
we
can
just
ask
what
language
does
John
speak
which
is
translated
into
the
corresponding
query
speak
John
Y
Running
this
query
in
the
corresponding
logic
program
gives
the
result
that
Y
English
that
is
to
say
the
predicate
speak
John
English
is
true
Hence
the
corresponding
metalog
sentence
returned
as
answer
is
John
speaks
English
As
far
as
real
data
are
concerned
among
our
examples
we
have
run
the
above
example
using
a
set
of
2700
RDF
data
model
triples
that
correspond
with
the
data
available
at
the
World
Wide
Web
Consortium
technical
reports
page
This
page
presents
the
public
documents
the
consortium
has
published
along
with
their
authors
dates
and
URIs
Therefore
one
can
get
a
complete
knowledge
basis
regarding
W
3
C's
authors
that
is
flexible
and
elegantly
extendable
Related
work
The
use
of
Web
infrastructure
to
accommodate
logic
programs
has
been
suggested
by
Sandevall
1996
and
Loke
Davidson
1996
The
latter
approach
suggests
using
familiar
logic
program
notation
to
place
facts
and
queries
on
HTML
pages
The
embedded
rules
also
have
the
ability
to
refer
to
other
HTML
pages
with
other
predicates
using
a
namespace
mechanism
In
this
way
their
evaluation
context
increases
over
the
amount
of
HTML
pages
they
retrieve
to
find
facts
that
satisfy
the
queries
Conclusions
To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
this
is
the
first
work
that
addresses
the
problem
of
querying
RDF
models
and
extending
it
with
the
ability
of
expressing
reasoning
rules
The
metalog
model
that
we
have
sketched
is
general
enough
to
be
of
wide
use
and
powerful
enough
to
fulfill
most
of
the
generic
user's
needs
Moreover
it
is
elegantly
integrated
within
the
big
picture
of
W
3
C's
standards
with
a
particular
eye
geared
toward
extendability
and
future
improvements
It
tries
to
lower
the
access
level
to
metadata
and
reasoning
management
by
using
a
top-level
syntax
using
natural
language
enabling
not
only
easy
and
fast
writing
of
complex
relationships
but
also
an
extremely
high
readability
Finally
it
can
be
used
even
without
the
logical
extensions
just
to
provide
a
user-friendly
interface
to
RDF
Future
work
that
we
plan
to
do
within
W
3
C
is
the
deployment
of
a
publicly
accessible
prototype
of
the
system
so
to
foster
on
a
large
scale
use
of
structured
metadata
on
the
Web

Abstract
Logic
is
now
widely
recognized
to
be
one
of
the
foundational
disciplines
of
computing
with
applications
in
virtually
all
aspects
of
the
subject
from
software
engineering
and
hardware
development
to
programming
languages
and
artificial
intelligence
There
is
a
growing
need
for
an
in-depth
survey
of
the
applications
of
logic
in
AI
and
computer
science
The
Handbook
of
Logic
in
Artificial
Intelligence
and
Logic
Programming
and
its
companion
Handbook
of
Logic
in
Computer
Science
have
been
created
in
response
to
this
need
This
book
is
a
combination
of
authoritative
exposition
comprehensive
survey
and
fundamental
research
that
explores
underlying
unifying
themes
in
the
various
subject
areas

The
new
W
3
C
standard
RDF
Resource
Description
Framework
describes
a
metadata
infrastructure
which
can
accommodate
classification
elements
from
different
vocabularies
i.e
schemas
The
underlying
model
consists
of
a
labeled
directed
acyclic
graph
which
can
be
linearized
into
eXtensible
Markup
Language
XML
transfer
syntax
for
interchange
between
applications.This
paper
will
demonstrate
how
a
new
system
Metalog
allows
users
to
write
metadata
inference
rules
and
queries
in
English-like
syntax
We
will
demonstrate
how
these
reasoning
rules
have
equivalent
representation
both
as
RDF
descriptions
and
as
logic
formulae
We
will
also
show
how
an
automated
compilation
between
these
translations
is
possible
showing
the
effectiveness
of
the
system
which
aims
to
be
a
first
step
towards
the
ambitious
project
of
Tim
Berners-Lee's
semantic
web
The
Metalog
Approach
RDF
provides
the
basis
for
structuring
the
data
present
in
the
web
in
a
consistent
and
accurate
way
However
RDF
is
only
the
first
step
towards
the
construction
of
what
Tim
Berners-Lee
calls
the
semantic
web
a
World
Wide
Web
where
data
is
structured
and
users
can
fully
benefit
by
this
structure
when
accessing
information
on
the
web
RDF
only
provides
the
basic
vocabulary
in
which
data
can
be
expressed
and
structured
Then
the
whole
problem
of
accessing
an
managing
these
data
structured
arises
Metalog
provides
a
logical
view
of
metadata
present
on
the
web
The
Metalog
approach
is
composed
by
two
major
layers
The
first
layer
consists
in
an
enrichment
of
the
RDF
model
Metalog
provides
way
to
express
logical
relationships
like
and
or
and
so
on
and
to
build
up
complex
inference
rules
that
encode
logical
reasoning
This
semantic
layer
builds
on
top
of
RDF
using
a
so-called
RDF
schema
We
call
this
level
of
Metalog
the
Metalog
model
level
The
second
layer
consists
of
a
logical
interpretation
of
RDF
data
optionally
enriched
with
the
semantic
schema
into
logic
This
way
the
understood
semantics
of
RDF
is
unwound
into
its
logical
components
This
means
that
every
reasonment
on
RDF
data
can
be
performed
acting
upon
the
corresponding
logical
view
providing
a
neat
and
powerful
way
to
reason
about
data
We
call
this
level
of
Metalog
the
Metalog
logic
level
The
third
layer
is
a
language
interface
to
writing
structured
data
and
reasoning
rules
In
principle
the
first
component
already
suffices
data
and
rules
can
be
written
directly
in
RDF
using
RDF
syntax
and
the
metalog
schema
However
this
is
not
convenient
from
the
practical
viewpoint
Indeed
RDF
syntax
aims
at
being
more
an
encoding
language
rather
than
a
user-friendly
language
and
it
is
well
recognised
in
the
RDF
community
and
among
vendors
that
the
typical
applications
will
provide
more
user-friendly
interfaces
between
the
raw
RDF
code
and
the
user
Our
proposed
language
is
innovative
in
that
it
tries
to
stress
user-friendliness
as
much
as
possible
a
program
is
a
collection
of
natural
language
assertions
We
think
this
feature
will
be
particularly
important
for
the
wide
deployment
not
only
of
metalog
but
of
RDF
itself
the
measure
of
the
success
of
metadata
and
proper
structuring
of
information
on
the
web
is
given
by
the
number
of
people
that
will
actually
lose
time
and
energy
in
write
and/or
translate
data
into
the
structured
format
Therefore
it
is
of
primary
importance
that
the
entry
level
is
kept
extremely
easy
to
avoid
that
the
difficulty
of
just
learning
how
to
encode
and
structure
data
will
just
block
the
widespread
diffusion
of
metadata
in
the
web
Also
this
level
incorporates
in
a
natural
way
the
concept
of
query
to
interact
with
the
structured
data
and
the
inference
rule
We
call
this
level
of
Metalog
the
Metalog
language
level
Another
important
feature
of
the
language
in
this
respect
is
indeed
that
it
can
be
used
just
as
an
interface
to
RDF
without
the
metalog
extensions
This
way
users
will
be
able
to
access
and
structure
metadata
using
RDF
in
a
smooth
and
seamless
way
using
the
metalog
language
Therefore
the
typical
interaction
of
the
user
with
the
Metalog
system
will
be
in
the
building
process
of
setting
up
the
data
and
the
logical
inferences
the
user
will
be
able
to
simply
express
these
using
the
Metalog
language
This
layer
is
translated
into
the
Metalog
model
and
then
using
the
Metalog
logic
interpretation
into
logic
From
here
classic
inference
engines
can
then
be
applied
like
logic
programming
datalog
theorem
provers
and
so
on
Also
all
the
already
existing
RDF
data
will
enter
this
chain
directly
into
the
Metalog
model
level
The
Metalog
Model
We
can
extend
RDF
so
that
the
mapping
to
logic
is
able
to
take
advantage
of
all
of
the
logical
relationships
present
in
logical
systems
that
is
to
say
behind
the
ability
of
expressing
static
facts
we
want
the
ability
to
encode
dynamic
reasoning
rules
like
in
logic
programming
In
order
to
do
so
we
need
at
least
the
connectors
and
or
implies
variables
The
metalog
schema
extends
plain
RDF
with
this
logical
layer
enabling
to
express
arbitrary
logical
relationships
within
RDF
In
fact
the
metalog
schema
provides
more
accessories
besides
the
aforementioned
basic
ones
like
for
example
the
not
connector
and
support
for
math
operators
anyway
for
the
sake
of
clarity
we
don't
go
into
further
details
on
this
topic
the
basic
building
blocks
are
the
connectors
and
or
implies
and
the
variables
What
the
reader
should
keep
in
mind
is
therefore
just
that
the
Metalog
model
provides
the
meta-logic
operators
to
reason
with
RDF
statements
Technically
this
is
quite
easy
to
do
the
metalog
schema
is
just
a
schema
as
defined
by
the
RDF
schema
specification
where
for
example
and
and
or
are
subinstances
of
the
RDF
Bag
connector
The
Metalog
Logic
Once
we
have
extended
syntactically
the
RDF
model
with
connectors
the
next
step
is
to
provide
a
semantical
interpretation
of
these
in
conjunction
with
a
semantical
interpretation
of
the
RDF
model
that
is
to
say
a
semantical
interpretation
of
the
Metalog
model
as
a
whole
The
first
correspondence
in
Metalog
is
between
the
basic
RDF
data
model
and
the
predicates
in
logic
The
RDF
data
model
consists
of
so-called
statements
Statements
are
triples
where
there
is
a
subject
the
resource
a
predicate
the
property
and
an
object
the
literal
Metalog
views
an
RDF
statement
in
the
logical
setting
as
just
a
binary
predicate
involving
the
subject
and
the
literal
For
example
the
RDF
statement
expressing
the
fact
that
Tim
Berners-Lee
invented
the
Web
formally
the
RDF
triple
invented
Tim
Berners-Lee
Web
is
seen
in
logic
as
the
predicate
invented(Tim
Berners-Lee
Web
So
in
general
RDF
statements
have
a
natural
translation
into
logic
predicates
The
exceptions
that
Metalog
does
are
for
the
so-called
sequencing
constructs
in
RDF
Bag
Seq
and
Alt
These
are
codified
using
specific
varyadic
functors
named
indeed
Bag
Seq
and
Alt
with
in
addition
in
the
Bag
case
equations
to
make
the
Bag
operator
act
like
a
set-like
operator
that
is
to
say
Bag(X
1
X_n
Bag(X_p
1
X_p(n
for
every
permutation
p
So
in
fact
Metalog
logic
is
a
kind
of
equational
logic
see
also
later
in
the
case
of
the
mathematical
operators
The
second
natural
correspondence
is
the
interpretation
of
the
specific
Metalog
extension
the
connectors
and
or
and
implies
are
interpreted
as
the
logical
conjunction
disjunction
and
implication
respectively
Variables
are
interpreted
as
logical
variables
En
passant
we
mention
the
other
extensions
provided
by
Metalog
the
not
connector
and
the
mathematical
extensions
Metalog
provides
support
for
integer
arithmetic
with
the
functions
add
sub
times
divide
and
the
predicates
less
greater
less_or_equal
greater_or_equal
that
have
the
expected
equational
interpretation
As
far
as
the
not
connector
is
concerned
things
are
less
easy
while
for
the
other
interpretation
the
logical
interpretation
is
rather
straightforward
in
other
words
in
the
almost
totality
of
the
useful
logics
these
operators
have
all
the
same
interpretation
a
logical
interpretation
of
the
not
connector
is
not
as
plain
there
are
different
alternatives
to
consider
giving
different
logics
The
Metalog
choice
follows
from
the
intrinsic
nature
of
the
World
Wide
Web
where
the
Metalog
system
is
expected
to
be
used
as
a
distributed
knowledge
basis
with
possibly
partial
information
available
we
chose
the
interpretation
of
the
not
connector
to
be
negation
as
failure
NAF
that
is
to
say
we
opted
for
the
Closed
World
Assumption
CWA
Another
point
to
consider
is
that
since
the
interpretation
of
the
not
is
in
any
case
such
a
delicate
parameter
the
interpretation
of
the
not
as
NAF
has
been
kept
as
flexible
as
possible
using
namespaces
as
we
will
see
next
Summing
up
the
mapping
between
the
Metalog
model
and
logical
formulas
is
then
completely
natural
for
each
RDF
statement
that
does
not
use
a
metalog
connector
there
is
a
corresponding
logical
predicate
as
defined
before
Then
the
metalog
connectors
are
translated
into
the
corresponding
logical
connectors
as
described
above
Namespaces
Metalog
employs
different
namespaces
for
its
extensions
in
order
to
allows
easy
extensibility
modification
and
reuse
of
its
components
Therefore
there
are
three
different
namespaces
in
action
the
first
namespace
http
www.w
3
org/RDF/Metalog
is
for
the
connectors
and
or
implies
and
for
the
variables
that
is
to
say
the
core
set
of
Metalog
Then
the
not
connector
has
a
different
namespace
namely
http
www.w
3
org/RDF/Metalog/not/NAF
thus
allowing
other
different
not's
to
be
used
if
needed
Finally
all
the
mathematical
extensions
have
yet
another
namespaces
http
www.w
3
org/RDF/Metalog/Math
to
allow
easy
upgrade/extensions
of
the
mathematical
facilities
in
the
future
The
Metalog
Syntax
The
third
layer
is
then
the
actual
syntax
interface
between
the
user
and
the
Metalog
model
layer
The
metalog
syntax
has
been
explicitly
designed
with
the
purpose
of
being
totally
natural-language
based
trying
to
avoid
any
possible
technicalities
and
therefore
making
the
language
extremely
readable
and
self-descriptive
The
way
metalog
reaches
this
scope
is
by
a
careful
use
of
upper/lower
case
quotes
and
by
allowing
a
rather
liberal
positioning
of
the
keywords
an
advanced
parser
then
disambiguates
the
keywords
from
each
metalog
program
line
Upper/lower
case
is
used
to
distinguish
between
normal
keywords
and
variables
variables
are
expressed
using
names
all
in
upper
case
for
example
FOO
is
a
variable
Words
that
are
in
lower
case
either
are
keywords
reserved
words
or
if
not
they
are
ignored
For
example
then
is
a
keyword
while
foo
is
not
and
so
it
is
just
ignored
it
is
only
syntactic
sugaring
Other
words
can
be
either
keywords
or
they
are
just
ignored
In
the
current
version
of
metalog
words
cannot
intermingle
upper
and
lower
case
this
helps
to
reduce
errors
and
to
improve
readability
since
it
strengthens
the
layout
difference
between
variables
and
the
other
words
Finally
any
name
which
is
between
double
quotes
for
example
John
is
a
datum
a
fixed
constant
Keywords
The
following
set
of
keywords
are
reserved
in
metalog
Interpretation
of
the
keywords
is
done
in
metalog
on
a
positional
basis
the
position
of
the
keyword
with
respect
to
other
keywords
and/or
other
data
determines
the
interpretation
of
the
sentence
The
reserved
keywords
are
then
is
a
keyword
for
the
logical
implication
For
example
if
SHE
has
a
degree
in
math
then
SHE
is
smart
is
translated
into
the
logical
formula
degree(SHE
math
is(SHE
smart
Note
that
here
and
in
the
following
examples
we
provide
directly
the
translation
into
the
logical
formula
to
save
space
a
more
detailed
translation
would
have
to
also
show
the
intermediate
RDF
model
which
is
in
any
case
trivial
to
derive
imply
is
a
keyword
for
the
logical
implication
implies
is
a
keyword
for
the
logical
implication
and
can
be
either
the
metalog
and
the
logical-and
or
it
can
be
used
to
indicate
the
presence
of
an
RDF
Bag
the
bag-and
this
is
disambiguated
by
the
context
For
example
if
SHE
has
a
degree
in
math
and
SHE
has
a
degree
in
computer
science
as
well
then
SHE
is
really
smart
is
translated
into
the
logical
formula
degree(SHE
math
and
degree(SHE
computer
science
is(SHE
really
smart
On
the
other
hand
as
said
and
can
be
used
to
denote
an
RDF
Bag
a
set
the
technical
report
231
has
as
authors
Mary
and
John
is
translated
into
the
logical
formula
authors
technical
report
231
Bag
Mary
John
or
can
be
either
the
metalog
or
or
it
can
be
used
to
indicate
the
presence
of
an
RDF
Alt
an
alternatives
list
this
is
disambiguated
by
the
context
order
the
presence
of
this
keyword
turns
an
RDF
Bag
into
an
RDF
Seq
an
ordered
list
For
example
the
technical
report
231
has
as
authors
Mary
and
John
in
this
order
is
translated
into
the
logical
formula
authors
technical
report
231
Seq
Mary
John
not
can
be
combined
with
other
metalog
constructs
For
example
if
SHE
has
a
degree
in
math
then
SHE
is
not
stupid
is
translated
into
the
logical
formula
degree(SHE
math
not(is(SHE
stupid
The
dot
is
the
separator
between
metalog
program
lines
For
formatting
purposes
carriage
returns
line
feeds
can
tabs
can
be
used
they
are
simply
ignored
Commas
semicolons
and
question
marks
are
reserved
keywords
we'll
explain
commas
in
the
next
section
and
question
marks
in
the
Queries
section
On
the
other
hand
semicolons
are
reserved
for
future
use
Note
metalog
programs
also
have
a
number
of
other
keywords
to
deal
with
to
name
some
namespaces
via
the
keyword
namespace
mathematical
operators
versioning
We
will
not
go
in
further
details
since
we
won't
be
explicitly
using
namespaces
sugaring
here
but
en
passant
we
just
mention
that
essentially
the
namespace
keyword
has
the
same
functionality
as
the
xmlns
attribute
for
XML
namespaces
And
as
said
there
are
a
number
of
other
keywords
that
deal
with
numbers
operations
e.g
greater
less
etc
but
for
the
sake
of
brevity
we
don't
go
in
their
rather
obvious
description
Parsing
Parsing
is
positional
Let's
introduce
some
terminology
here
Call
quotation
everything
that
in
a
metalog
language
chunk
is
among
quotes
keyword
and
variable
have
just
the
usual
metalog
meaning
Call
a
holder
either
a
variable
or
a
quotation
So
for
example
in
SHE
has
a
degree
in
math
then
SHE
is
smart
the
quotations
are
degree
math
is
and
smart
the
variables
are
SHE
all
of
these
are
holders
the
keywords
are
then
Interpretation
then
occurs
as
follows
First
a
so-called
strip-off
phase
occurs
where
all
the
junk
parts
that
are
neither
quotations
nor
variables
nor
keywords
are
eliminated
Note
that
it
is
not
strictly
necessary
for
the
parser
to
do
a
strip-off
in
advance
and
indeed
in
our
current
implementation
the
strip-off
occurs
incrementally
as
the
sentences
are
processed
in
a
much
more
efficient
way
But
for
the
sake
of
explanation
it's
clearer
to
assume
this
strip-off
part
is
executed
in
advance
So
in
the
above
example
after
strip-off
we
obtain
SHE
degree
math
then
SHE
is
smart
Then
we
disambiguate
using
the
metalog
keywords
The
basic
metalog
mapping
structure
here
we
use
a
mapping
directly
to
logic
rather
than
to
Metalog
model
for
conciseness
follows
the
classic
grammatical
model
of
basic
sentence
where
we
have
a
subject
followed
by
a
predicate
and
then
an
object
This
triple
subject
predicate
object
is
naturally
translated
into
the
logic
binary
predicate
predicate(subject,object
On
top
of
this
basic
model
of
translation
more
sophisticated
constructs
are
added
using
the
metalog
keywords
Metalog
has
several
interoperating
rules
that
deal
with
keyword
processing
and
ambiguities
In
the
following
we
describe
the
core
parsing
algorithm
to
give
an
idea
of
the
kind
of
algorithmic
involved
Let's
refer
to
level
1
2
or
3
if
we
are
at
a
position
where
we
expect
to
have
a
subject
predicate
or
object
For
example
if
we
are
parsing
the
above
example
from
left
to
right
and
we
are
at
the
point
if
SHE
has
a
degree
then
we've
just
parsed
a
level
2
degree
and
expect
a
level
3
Parsing
occurs
left-to-right
according
to
the
above
general
pattern
only
that
when
a
keywords
is
found
various
things
can
happen
if
we
find
a
then
imply
or
implies
keyword
it
means
we
translate
all
what
was
to
the
left
say
obtaining
LEFT
all
what
is
to
the
right
say
obtaining
RIGHT
and
logically
translate
to
LEFT
RIGHT
here
denotes
logical
implication
Note
that
a
then
can
generally
occur
only
when
a
level
1
is
expected
although
the
above
definition
is
more
general
If
we
find
an
and
if
the
and
occurs
when
a
level
1
is
expected
then
it
could
be
a
logical-and
or
the
bag-and
if
there's
a
holder
soon
after
the
object
to
the
right
of
the
and
then
it's
a
logical-and
otherwise
it's
a
bag-and
and
the
level
still
stays
3
If
the
and
occurs
when
a
level
2
is
expected
then
it's
a
bag-and
it
means
that
the
holder
soon
before
the
and
and
the
next
to
come
are
concatenated
into
an
RDF
Bag
construct
Bag
than
can
be
turned
into
an
RDF
Seq
if
the
order
keyword
is
found
Logical-and
translation
we
have
the
logical
translation
LEFT
and
RIGHT
For
example
take
the
metalog
sentence
if
SHE
and
HE
have
a
degree
in
math
and
science
and
John
is
good
then
Doing
the
strip
off
we
obtain
SHE
and
HE
degree
math
and
science
and
John
is
good
then
Now
we
start
the
parsing
from
left
to
right
in
the
following
the
denote
with
Bag(a,b,c
the
bag
composed
by
elements
a
b
c
SHE
level
1
and
where
a
level
2
was
expected
so
HE
Bag(SHE,HE
is
the
new
level
1
degree
level
2
math
level
3
and
where
level
1
was
expected
after
science
there
is
a
keyword
so
it's
a
bag-and
which
means
science
Bag
math
science
is
level
3
and
where
level
1
was
expected
after
John
there
is
a
holder
good
so
it's
a
logical-and
John
level
1
is
level
2
good
level
3
then
all
of
the
above
LEFT
implies
all
of
the
following
RIGHT
So
the
final
logical
translation
is
degree(Bag(SHE,HE
Bag
math
science
and
is
John
good
Another
important
component
in
the
metalog
language
syntax
is
represented
by
punctuation
Punctuation
plays
a
relevant
role
to
define
the
structure
of
metalog
for
example
dots
are
used
to
separate
metalog
sentences
and
question
marks
to
denote
queries
Besides
these
commas
are
used
to
act
as
delimiter
a
helpful
construct
in
case
ambiguities
arise
For
example
consider
the
following
example
obtained
slightly
modifying
the
above
example
if
SHE
and
HE
have
a
degree
in
math
and
science
and
John
and
Mary
are
good
then
This
sentence
is
given
the
supposedly
wrong
interpretation
by
Metalog
that
degree(Bag(SHE,HE
Bag
math
science
John
and
are
Mary
good
while
to
express
the
fact
that
both
John
and
Mary
are
good
we
can
use
the
comma
punctuation
the
above
example
becomes
if
SHE
and
HE
have
a
degree
in
math
and
science
and
John
and
Mary
are
good
then
or
equivalently
if
SHE
and
HE
have
a
degree
in
math
and
science
and
John
and
Mary
are
good
then
The
formal
rule
to
deal
with
commas
in
the
parsing
process
is
that
a
comma
forces
a
level
1
Queries
In
general
query
languages
are
formal
languages
to
retrieve
data
from
a
database
Standardized
languages
already
exist
to
retrieve
information
from
different
types
of
databases
such
as
Structured
Query
Language
SQL
for
relational
databases
and
Object
Query
Language
OQL
for
object
databases
Semi-structured
query
languages
such
as
XML-QL
3
operate
on
the
document
level
structure
With
RDF
the
most
suitable
approach
is
to
focus
on
the
underlying
data
model
Even
though
XML-QL
could
be
used
to
query
RDF
descriptions
in
their
XML
encoded
form
a
single
RDF
data
model
could
not
be
correctly
determined
with
a
single
XML-QL
query
due
to
the
fact
that
RDF
allows
several
XML
syntax
encodings
for
the
same
data
model
And
XML-QL
and
other
similar
XML
query
languages
see
QL
98
7
have
the
big
limitation
to
query
syntactically
and
not
semantically
Instead
the
fact
the
ultimate
point
of
the
Metalog
chain
is
the
Metalog
logic
leads
itself
to
a
natural
definition
of
query
constructive
satisfability
That
is
to
say
any
given
logical
formula
can
be
queried
along
the
database
to
check
whether
it
is
satisfable
or
not
and
in
the
positive
case
the
appropriate
variable
bindings
are
to
be
returned
We
provide
a
construct
in
the
Metalog
language
to
express
such
a
query
the
question
mark
every
metalog
language
sentence
ending
with
a
question
mark
is
supposed
to
be
a
query
and
as
such
it
should
not
be
added
to
the
knowledge
base
but
its
satisfability
can
be
possibly
checked
by
an
appropriate
inference
engine
Computability
Note
that
the
RDF
metalog
model
and
the
corresponding
translation
into
logical
formulas
in
the
Metalog
logic
is
absolutely
general
However
in
practice
one
need
also
to
then
be
able
to
process
the
resulting
logical
formulas
in
an
effective
ways
In
other
words
while
the
Metalog
model
nicely
extends
RDF
with
the
full
power
of
first
order
predicate
calculus
and
more
thus
increasing
by
far
the
expressibility
of
basic
RDF
there
is
still
the
other
computational
side
of
the
coin
how
to
process
and
effectively
reason
with
all
these
logical
inference
rules
Metalog
as
such
does
not
impose
computability
restriction
as
its
primary
goal
is
to
provide
expressibility
means
to
codify
logical
data
and
relationships
and
relative
queries
Then
it
is
up
to
the
particular
inference
engine
to
try
to
effectively
deal
with
the
resulting
logical
knowledge
basis
However
there
are
at
least
two
restrictions
of
the
logic
that
deserves
particular
attention
logic
programming
and
datalog
see
e.g
1
These
paradigms
are
that
they
are
computationally
rather
efficient
such
that
there
are
many
implementations
available
that
implement
these
languages
moreover
in
the
case
of
datalog
querying
is
also
always
terminating
that
is
to
say
no
matter
what
query
we
give
a
datalog
program
if
correctly
implemented
will
always
return
the
answer(s
in
a
finite
amount
of
time
The
interesting
things
that
makes
these
languages
particularly
appealing
in
our
case
is
due
to
the
fact
that
both
logic
programming
and
datalog
restrict
to
binary
predicates
this
means
that
RDF
without
the
ordering
structures
is
already
directly
mappable
via
Metalog
into
a
logic
program
Therefore
just
relatively
small
syntactical
constraints
enables
a
metalog
language
program
and
so
logic
formula
to
be
ultimately
processed
in
an
effective
way
using
an
already
existing
logic
programming
or
datalog
inference
engine
This
is
indeed
what
we
are
currently
doing
with
our
current
prototype
interfacing
with
existing
logic
programming/datalog
systems
like
for
example
8
The
way
Metalog
deals
with
such
syntactic
restrictions
is
twofold
The
first
is
liberal
it
is
up
to
the
implementation
to
check
whether
the
metalog
language
code
does
actually
satisfy
the
corresponding
restrictions
such
to
be
interpreted
as
a
logic
program
or
as
a
datalog
program
This
is
consistent
with
the
general
philosophy
of
Metalog
as
being
a
purely
declarative
and
highly
expressive
language
The
second
way
is
to
actually
annotate
the
metalog
language
code
with
a
restriction
tag
a
restriction
tag
is
a
metalog
sentence
expressing
the
fact
that
the
code
indeed
satisfies
the
appropriate
syntactic
restrictions
So
far
there
are
two
restriction
tags
one
for
logic
programming
and
the
other
for
datalog
It
is
important
to
note
that
these
restriction
tags
are
just
annotations
that
is
to
say
they
are
in
all
equivalent
to
comments
but
for
the
fact
that
they
provide
a
hint
to
an
eventual
application
that
tries
to
process
the
metalog
code
that
some
particular
inference
engine
for
logic
programs
datalog
programs
etc
could
be
profitably
used
It
is
semantically
transparent
since
there
is
no
actual
representation
of
a
restriction
tag
in
the
metalog
model
layer
A
more
detailed
example
Suppose
we
want
to
encode
the
rule
that
if
a
person
is
the
author
of
a
document
in
some
language
for
example
English
then
he
can
speak
in
that
language
The
corresponding
metalog
program
would
be
if
the
language
of
a
DOCUMENT
is
Y
and
the
author
of
the
DOCUMENT
is
X
then
X
can
speak
Y
This
can
be
translated
into
the
following
piece
of
XML/RDF
syntax
implies
rdf:Seq
rdf:li
and
rdf:Seq
rdf:li
Predicate
name
language
rdf
seq
rdf:li
Variable
DOCUMENT
Variable
rdf:li
rdf:li
Variable
Y
Variable
rdf:li
rdf:seq
Predicate
rdf:li
rdf:li
Predicate
name
author
rdf
seq
rdf:li
Variable
DOCUMENT
Variable
rdf:li
rdf:li
Variable
X
Variable
rdf:li
rdf:seq
Predicate
rdf:li
rdf:Seq
and
rdf:li
rdf:li
Predicate
name
speak
rdf
seq
rdf:li
Variable
X
Variable
rdf:li
rdf:li
Variable
Y
Variable
rdf:li
rdf:seq
Predicate
rdf:li
rdf:Seq
implies
And
finally
this
corresponds
to
the
logical
formula
speak(X,Y
author(DOCUMENT,X
and
language(DOCUMENT,Y
This
formula
is
just
a
Horn
clause
and
as
such
it
means
it
can
be
viewed
as
a
logic
program
So
suppose
we
have
already
grabbed
from
somewhere
in
the
Web
some
pieces
of
RDF
that
tell
us
for
example
that
John
is
the
author
of
technical
report
231
and
that
the
language
of
technical
report
231
is
English
This
again
can
be
viewed
as
part
of
a
logic
program
technically
they
are
facts
Then
if
we
want
to
know
what
language
does
John
speak
we
can
just
ask
what
language
does
John
speak
which
is
translated
into
the
corresponding
query
speak
John
Y
Running
this
query
in
the
corresponding
logic
program
gives
the
result
that
Y
English
that
is
to
say
the
predicate
speak
John
English
is
true
Hence
the
corresponding
metalog
sentence

The
more
ambitious
project
that
we
are
tackling
right
now
using
Metalog
is
the
complete
management
of
the
W

web
site
W

C
is
a
complex
organization
and
its
web
site
is
the
big
white
board
on
which
information
is
shared
and
processed
Thousands
of
people
every
day
look
for
related
information
and
produce
new
information
on
the
W
3
C
site
All
this
information
is
stored
like
the
state
of
the
art
allows
part
is
stored
in
separate
databases
files
and
the
vast
majority
just
resides
in
static
web
pages
Therefore
to
access
and
manipulate
the
information
one
has
to
either
go
and
perform
a
manual
search
or
resort
on
primitive
tools
like
the
local
Altavista-based
search
engine
The
next-generation
W

site
instead
will
hopefully
be
based
on
the
Metalog
infrastructure

The

Framework
RDF
Model&Syntax
Specification
describes
a
metadata
infrastructure
which
can
accommodate
classification
elements
from
different
vocabularies
i.e
schemas
The
underlying
model
consists
of
a
labeled

acyclic
graph
which
can
be
linearized
into
eXtensible
Markup
Language
XML
transfer
syntax
for
interchange
between

This
paper
will
demonstrate
how
a
new
querying
language
Metalog
allows
users
to
write
inference
rules
and
queries
in
English-like
syntax
We
will
demonstrate
how
these
reasoning
rules
have
equivalent
representation
both
as
RDF
descriptions
and
as
logic
programs
We
will
also
show
how
an
automated
compilation
between
these
translations
is
possible
For
the
sake
of
clarity
here
we
will
just
give
an
overview
of
the
system
trying
to
avoid
technicalities
and
cumbersome
details
Query
Languages
In
general
query
languages
are
formal
languages
to
retrieve
data
from
a
database
Standardadized
languages
already
exist
to
retrieve
information
from
different
types
of
databases
such
as
Structured
Query
Language
SQL
for
relational
databases
and
Object
Query
Language
OQL
and
SQL
3
for
object
relational
databases
Semi-structured
query
languages
such
as
XML-QL
3
operate
on
a
document
level
structure
taking
advantage
of
the
internal
element
structure
of
an
XML
document
Logic
programs
consist
of
facts
and
rules
where
valid
inference
rules
are
used
to
arrives
into
new
facts
i.e
query
results
With
RDF
the
most
suitable
approach
is
to
focus
on
the
underlying
data
model
Even
though
XML-QL
could
be
used
to
query
RDF
descriptions
in
their
XML
encoded
form
a
single
RDF
data
model
could
not
be
correctly
determined
with
a
single
XML-QL
query
due
to
the
fact
that
RDF
allows
several
XML
syntax
encodings
for
the
same
data
model
The
Metalog
Approach
RDF
provides
the
basis
for
structuring
the
data
present
on
the
Web
in
a
consistent
and
accurate
way
However
RDF
is
only
the
first
step
towards
the
construction
of
what
Tim
Berners-Lee
calls
the
Web
of
knowledge
a
World
Wide
Web
where
data
is
structured
and
users
can
fully
benefit
by
this
structure
when
accessing
information
on
the
Web
RDF
only
provides
the
basic
vocabulary
in
which
data
can
be
expressed
and
structured
Then
the
whole
problem
of
accessing
an
managing
these
data
structures
arises
Metalog
provides
a
logical
view
of
metadata
present
on
the
Web
The
Metalog
approach
is
composed
of
several
components
In
the
first
component
a
particular
data
semantics
is
established
Metalog
provides
way
to
express
logical
relationships
such
as
and
or
and
to
build
up
complex
inference
rules
that
encode
logical
reasoning
This
semantic
layer
builds
on
top
of
RDF
using
a
so-called
RDF
schema
The
second
component
consists
of
a
logical
interpretation
of
RDF
data
optionally
enriched
with
the
semantic
schema
into
logic
programming
This
way
the
understood
semantics
of
RDF
is
unwielded
into
its
logical
components
a
logic
program
indeed
This
means
that
every
reasonment
on
RDF
data
can
be
performed
acting
upon
the
corresponding
logical
view
the
logic
program
providing
a
neat
and
powerful
way
to
reason
about
data
The
third
component
is
a
language
interface
to
writing
structured
data
and
reasoning
rules
In
principle
the
first
component
already
suffices
data
and
rules
can
be
written
directly
in
RDF
using
RDF
syntax
and
the
Metalog
schema
However
this
is
not
convenient
from
the
practical
viewpoint
Indeed
RDF
syntax
aims
at
being
more
an
encoding
language
rather
than
a
user-friendly
language
and
it
is
well
recognised
in
the
RDF
community
and
among
vendors
that
the
typical
applications
will
provide
more
user-friendly
interfaces
between
the
raw
RDF
code
and
the
user
Our
proposed
language
is
innovative
in
that
it
tries
to
stress
user-friendliness
as
much
as
possible
a
program
is
a
collection
of
natural
language
assertions
We
think
this
feature
will
be
particularly
important
for
the
wide
deployment
not
only
of
metalog
but
of
RDF
itself
the
measure
of
the
success
of
metadata
and
proper
structuring
of
information
on
the
Web
is
given
by
the
number
of
people
that
will
actually
lose
time
and
energy
in
write
and/or
translate
data
into
the
structured
format
Therefore
it
is
of
primary
importance
that
the
entry
level
is
kept
extremely
easy
to
avoid
that
the
difficuly
of
just
learning
how
to
encode
and
structure
data
will
just
block
the
widespread
diffusion
of
metadata
on
the
Web
Another
important
feature
of
the
language
in
this
respect
is
indeed
that
it
can
be
used
just
as
an
interface
to
RDF
without
the
metalog
extensions
This
way
users
will
be
able
to
access
and
structure
metadata
using
RDF
in
a
smooth
and
seamless
way
using
the
metalog
language
The
Metalog
Schema
The
first
correspondance
in
Metalog
is
between
the
basic
RDF
data
model
and
the
predicates
in
logic
The
RDF
data
model
consists
of
so-called
statements
Statements
are
triples
where
there
is
a
subject
the
resource
a
predicate
the
property
and
an
object
the
literal
Metalog
views
an
RDF
statement
in
the
logical
setting
as
just
a
binary
predicate
involving
the
subject
and
the
literal
For
example
the
RDF
statement
expressing
the
fact
that
Tim
Berners-Lee
invented
the
Web
formally
the
RDF
triple
invented
Tim
Berners-Lee
Web
is
seen
in
logic
programming
as
the
predicate
invented(Tim
Berners-Lee
Web
Once
we
have
estalished
the
basic
correspondance
between
the
basic
RDF
data
model
and
predicates
in
logic
the
next
step
becomes
easy
we
can
extend
RDF
so
that
the
mapping
to
logic
is
able
to
take
advantage
of
all
of
the
logical
relationships
present
in
logical
systems
that
is
to
say
beyond
the
ability
of
expressing
static
facts
we
want
the
ability
to
encode
dynamic
reasoning
rules
like
in
logic
programming
In
order
to
do
so
we
need
at
least
the
standard
logical
connectors
and
or
not
variables
The
Metalog
schema
extends
plain
RDF
with
this
logical
layer
enabling
the
expression
of
arbitrary
logical
relationships
within
RDF
In
fact
the
Metalog
schema
provides
more
accessories
besides
the
aforementioned
basic
ones
Without
elaborating
here
all
the
Metalog
schema
elements
since
they
will
be
presented
later
what
the
reader
should
keep
in
mind
is
just
that
the
Metalog
schema
provides
the
meta-logic
operators
to
reason
with
RDF
statements
Technically
this
is
quite
easy
to
do
the
metalog
schema
is
just
a
schema
as
defined
by
the
RDF
schema
specification
Brickley
99
where
for
example
and
and
or
are
sub-instances
of
the
RDF
Bag
connector
The
mapping
between
metalog
RDF
and
logical
formulas
is
then
completely
natural
for
each
RDF
statement
that
does
not
use
a
Metalog
connector
there
is
a
corresponding
logical
predicate
as
defined
before
Then
the
metalog
connectors
are
translated
into
the
corresponding
logical
connectors
in
the
natural
way
so
for
instance
the
metalog
and
connector
is
mapped
using
logical
conjunction
while
the
metalog
or
connector
is
mapped
using
logical
disjunction
The
Metalog
Syntax
Note
that
the
RDF
metalog
schema
and
the
corresponding
translation
into
logical
formulas
is
absolutely
general
However
in
practicse
one
need
also
to
then
be
able
to
process
the
resulting
logical
formulas
in
an
effective
ways
In
other
words
while
the
RDF
metalog
schema
nicely
extends
RDF
with
the
full
power
of
first
order
predicate
calculus
thus
increasing
by
far
the
expressibility
of
basic
RDF
there
is
still
the
other
computational
side
of
the
coin
how
to
process
and
effectively
reason
with
all
these
logical
inference
rules
It
is
well
known
that
in
general
dealing
with
full
first
order
predicate
calculus
is
totally
unfeasable
computationally
So
what
we
would
like
to
have
is
a
subset
of
predicate
calculus
that
is
still
expressible
enough
and
also
computationally
feasible
our
choice
went
to
logic
programming
Logic
programming
see
e.g
1
is
a
well
known
programming
paradigm
that
selects
a
subset
of
full
first-order
predicate
calculus
so
called
Horn
clauses
it
is
a
very
powerful
and
expressive
paradigm
and
has
the
further
advantage
that
it
has
been
widely
studied
in
the
database
community
a
subset
of
logic
programming
datalog
has
even
the
advantage
of
having
computations
always
terminating
a
feature
of
obvious
interest
for
Web
queries
The
third
level
is
then
the
actual
syntax
interface
between
the
user
and
this
metalog
RDF
encoding
with
the
constraint
that
the
expressibility
of
the
language
must
fit
within
the
one
provided
by
logic
programming
The
metalog
syntax
has
been
explicitly
designed
with
the
purpose
of
being
totally
natural-language
based
trying
to
avoid
any
possible
technicalities
and
therefore
making
the
language
extrememly
readable
and
self-descriptive
The
way
metalog
reaches
this
scope
is
by
a
careful
use
of
upper/lower
case
quotes
and
by
allowing
a
rather
liberal
positioning
of
the
keywords
an
advanced
parser
then
disambiguates
the
keywords
from
each
metalog
program
line
Metalog
grammar
The
tokens
in
the
Metalog
language
can
be
rougly
divided
into
four
categories
1
variables
2
literals
3
keywords
4
noise
words
In
the
following
subsections
we
present
how
these
tokens
are
recognized
There
is
also
an
example
following
each
of
these
subsections
to
demonstrate
how
the
recognization
works
in
practice
Variables
Upper/lower
case
is
used
to
distingush
between
normal
keywords
and
variables
variables
are
expressed
using
names
all
in
upper
case
for
example
FOO
is
a
variable
Words
that
are
in
lower
case
either
are
keywords
reserved
words
or
if
not
they
are
ignored
For
example
then
is
a
keyword
while
foo
is
not
and
so
it
is
just
ignored
it
is
only
syntactic
sugaring
Other
words
can
be
either
keywords
or
they
are
just
ignored
In
the
current
version
of
metalog
words
cannot
intermingle
upper
and
lower
case
this
helps
to
reduce
errors
and
to
improve
readability
since
it
strengthens
the
layout
difference
between
variables
and
the
other
words

Keywords
The
following
set
of
keywords
are
reserved
in
metalog
Interpretation
of
the
keywords
is
done
in
metalog
on
a
positional
basis
the
position
of
the
keyword
with
respect
to
other
keywords
and/or
other
data
determines
the
interpretation
of
the
sentence
The
reserved
keywords
are
then
is
a
keyword
for
the
logical
implication
For
example
if
SHE
has
a
degree
in
math
then
SHE
is
smart
is
translated
into
the
logical
formula
degree(SHE
math
is(SHE
smart
Note
that
here
and
in
the
following
examples
we
provide
directly
the
translation
into
the
logical
formula
to
save
space
a
more
detailed
translation
would
have
to
also
show
the
intermediate
RDF
model
which
is
in
any
case
trivial
to
derive
imply
is
a
keyword
for
the
logical
implication
implies
is
a
keyword
for
the
logical
implication
and
can
be
either
the
metalog
and
or
it
can
be
used
to
indicate
the
presence
of
an
RDF
Bag
this
is
disambiguated
by
the
context
For
example
if
SHE
has
a
degree
in
math
and
SHE
has
a
degree
in
computer
science
as
well
then
SHE
is
really
smart
is
translated
into
the
logical
formula
degree(SHE
math
and
degree(SHE
computer
science
is(SHE
really
smart
On
the
other
hand
as
said
and
can
be
used
to
denote
an
RDF
Bag
a
set
the
technical
report
231
has
as
authors
Mary
and
John
is
translated
into
the
logical
formulas
the
translation
here
is
more
involved
since
the
RDF

construct
is
used

this
is

by

order
the

an

For
example
the

not

For

in
math
then
SHE

is
translated
into
the
logical
formula
degree(SHE

The

the
separator
between
metalog
program
lines
For
formatting
purposes
carriage

line
feeds
can
tabs

be
used
they
are
simply
ignored
Similarly
commas
and
semicolon
can
be
used
as
well
A
trailing
question
mark
is
used
to
denote
a
query
Note
metalog
programs
also
have
a
facility
to
express
namespaces
via
the
keyword
namespace
We
will
not
go
in
further
details
since
we
won't
be
explicitly
using
namespaces
sugaring
here
but
en
passant
we
just
mention
that
essentially
the
namespace
keyword
has
the
same
functionality
as
the
xmlns
attribute
for
XML
namespaces
Also
there
are
a
number
of
other
keywords
that
deal
for
example
with
numbers
operations
e.g
greater
less
etc
but
for
the
sake
of
brevity
we
don't
go
in
their
rather
obvious

Roles
of

Metalog
can
be
used
into
three
different
purposes
authoring

facts
rules
and

We
will
elaborate
their
definition
and
expression
in
Metalog
in
the
following
subsections
Facts
in
Metalog
Facts
are
recognized
by
the
lack
of
existance
of
both

keywords
withn
a

sentence
In
this
case
the

will
be

in

Rules
are
recognized
by

of

as
the

Let
us
examine

example
of

Queries
in

Queries
are
recognized

as
the

Let

Containers
in
RDF
Metalog
supports
the
container
structures
of
RDF
i.e
bags
alternatives
and
sequences
The
following
subsections
elaborate
how
these
structures
differ
from
each
other
and
how
they
are
encoded
in
Metalog
Bags
Bags
do
not
preserve
of
implicate
order
Thus
it
is
safe
to
say
multiple
values
within
a
statement
i.e
The
author
of
http
www.w

org/RDF/Metalog
are
Massimo
Marchiori
and
Janne
Saarela
literal
keyword(of
literal
keyword(are
literal
keyword(and
literal
Alternatives
Alternatives
imply
that
only
one
member
of
a
Alternative
container
is
valid
at
a
time
This
sets
requirements
for
authoring
and
querying
In
authoring
the
Metalog
statement
must
imply
the
values
of
the
statement
are
mutually
exclusive
with
the
reserved

of
In

Let
us
examine
the
tokenization
of

Massimo

Sequences
Sequences
do
preserve

in
RDF
which
sets
requirements
for
authoring
and
querying
In
authoring
the
Metalog
statement
must
imply
the
values
of
the
statement
have
order
with
the
order
reserved
keyword
In
querying
additional
constraints
can
be
set
to
a
query
i.e
whether
2
or
3
value
matches
or
multiple
values
match
in
given
order
Let
us
examine
the
tokenization
of

A
detailed
example
Suppose
we
want
to
encode
the
rule
that
if
a
person
has
written
a
document
in
some
language
for
example
English
then
he
can
speak
in
that
language
The
corresponding
metalog
program
would
be
if
the
language
of
a
DOCUMENT
is
Y
and
the
author
of
the
DOCUMENT
is
X
then
X
can
speak
Y
This
can
be
translated
into
the
following
piece
of
RDF
syntax
Procedure
Head
Conjunction
Predicate
name
speak
rdf:Seq
rdf:li
Variable
X
Variable

Predicates

Body
Procedure
And
finally
this
corresponds
to
the
logical
formula
speak(X,Y
author(DOCUMENT,X
and
language(DOCUMENT,Y
So
suppose
we
have
already
grabbed
from
somewhere
on
the
Web
some
pieces
of
RDF
that
tell
us
for
example
that
John
is
the
author
of
technical
report
231
and
that
the
language
of
technical
report
231
is
English
Then
if
we
want
to
know
what
language
does
John
speak
we
can
just
ask
what
language
does
John
speak
which
is
translated
into
the
corresponding
query
speak
John
Y
Running
this
query
in
the
corresponding
logic
program
gives
the
result
that
Y
English
that
is
to
say
the
predicate
speak
John
English
is
true
Hence
the
corresponding
metalog
sentence
returned
as
answer
is
John
speaks
English
As
far
as
real
data
are
concerned
among
our
examples
we
have
run
the
above
example
using
a
set
of
2700
RDF
data
model
triples
that
correspond
with
the
data
available
at
the
World
Wide
Web
Consortium
technical
reports
page
This
page
presents
the
public
documents
the
consortium
has
published
along
with
their
authors
dates
and
URIs
Therefore
one
can
get
a
complete
knowledge
basis
regarding
W
3
C's
authors
that
is
flexible
and
elegantly
extendable
Related
work
The
use
of
Web
infrastructure
to
accommodate
logic
programs
has
been
suggested
by
Sandevall
1996
and
Loke
Davidson
1996
The
latter
approach
suggests
using
familiar
logic
program
notation
to
place
facts
and
queries
on
HTML
pages
The
embedded
rules
also
have
the
ability
to
refer
to
other
HTML
pages
with
other
predicates
using
a
namespace
mechanism
In
this
way
their
evaluation
context
increases
over
the
amount
of
HTML
pages
they
retrieve
to
find
facts
that
satisfy
the
queries
Conclusions
To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
this
is
the
first
work
that
addresses
the
problem
of
querying
RDF
models
and
extending
it
with
the
ability
of
expressing
reasoning
rules
The
metalog
model
that
we
have
sketched
is
general
enough
to
be
of
wide
use
and
powerful
enough
to
fulfill
most
of
the
generic
user's
needs
Moreover
it
is
elegantly
integrated
within
the
big
picture
of
W
3
C's
standards
with
a
particular
eye
geared
toward
extendability
and
future
improvements
It
tries
to
lower
the
access
level
to
metadata
and
reasoning
management
by
using
a
top-level
syntax
using
natural
language
enabling
not
only
easy
and
fast
writing
of
complex
relationships
but
also
an
extremely
high
readability
Finally
it
can
be
used
even
without
the
logical
extensions
just
to
provide
a
user-friendly
interface
to
RDF
Future
work
that
we
plan
to
do
within
W
3
C
is
the
deployment
of
a
publicly
accessible
prototype
of
the
system
so
to
foster
on
a
large
scale
use
of
structured
metadata
on
the
Web

We
live
in
the
age
of
big
data
where
companies
need
to
gather
and
analyze
truly
massive
amounts
of
information
Companies
specializing
in
web
search
need
to
essentially
archive
and
analyze
the
entire
web
Social
media
sites
need
to
store
and
work
with
millions
of
user
profiles
Programmers
need
tools
that
will
efficiently
scale
up
to
these
kinds
of
tasks
This
course
introduces
the
theory
and
practice
of
distributed
programming
and
cluster
computing
where
such
problems
are
tackled
by
dividing
the
tasks
into
smaller
parts
and
running
them
across
many
machines
at
once
In
particular
we
will
cover
the
MapReduce
algorithm
and
its
popular
open-source
software
implementations

Most
programming
languages
e.g
Java
C
C
Python
are
imperative
languages
meaning
that
programs
are
written
as
sequences
of
instructions
that
change
program
state
However
imperative
programming
is
just
one
programming
paradigm
This
course
introduces
two
other
programming
paradigms
functional
and
logic
programming
Logic
programming
is
based
on
first-order
logic
while
functional
programming
is
based
on
the
lambda
calculus
Students
will
learn
the
basic
theoretical
foundations
as
well
as
how
to
program
in
two
relevant
languages
The
course
will
also
describe
the
importance
of
these
languages
to
the
field
of
AI
